<p class="center">PREFACE.</p>

<p>"A Trip to the Orient, the Story of a Mediterranean
Cruise," by Robert Urie Jacob, has been written
at the request of fellow-travelers who did not
have time to take notes by the way.</p>

<p>One said, "Do not write a guide book nor a love story,
but a simple narrative that will recall the incidents and
delightful experiences of the tour." Following these
suggestions, but with many misgivings, the author has
undertaken and completed the work, assisted in the
editing and proof-reading by Miss Ruth Collins, of the
Drexel Institute, and by Miss Anna C. Kauffman.</p>

<p>An interesting feature of the book is the large number
of illustrations made from artistic photographs, all of
which have been kindly contributed by amateur photographers.
It contains nearly two hundred illustrations of
views or incidents in Funchal, Granada, Algiers, Malta,
Athens, Constantinople, Jerusalem, Cairo, Luxor, Naples,
and Nice, reproduced from photographs taken by Mr.
L. O. Smith, Rev. G. B. Burnwood, Mr. Charles Louis
Sicarde, Mr. Franklin D. Edmunds, Mr. Roberts LeBoutellier,
Mrs. Charles S. Crosman, Miss M. Florence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
Pannebaker, Mr. Walter F. Price, Mr. S. L. Schumo,
Mr. George C. Darling, Mr. Howard E. Pepper, Mr.
John W. Converse, Mr. C. Edwin Webb, and Mr. Edwin
Alban Bailey.</p>

<p>The story was intended specially for voyagers who
have visited the same places, but it may be almost equally
interesting to those who are planning a similar trip. And
those who must stay at home may in these pages be able
to look through another's eyes at the places described.</p>

<p>If the book should in any slight way deepen the pleasant
memories of those who have made the trip, or if it should
give pleasure to those who must picture those scenes only
in their imagination, the author will feel that his effort
has not been in vain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">ON THE OCEAN.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">[Pg 1]</a></span></p>


<p>"Have you decided to go?" inquired my friend.
Before us on the table lay an illustrated booklet
containing the prospectus of a cruise to the
Mediterranean. Its contents had been under consideration
for some days.</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered, "I will write to-day to secure
state room accommodations for our party. Nevertheless
I am not quite sure that it is wise to take the trip."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"For two reasons. First, are seventy days long
enough to make a cruise of nearly fourteen thousand
miles and visit so many places? Second, with five
hundred passengers will there not be a crowd?"</p>

<p>"Well, those doubts never troubled me. Seventy
days is all that can be spared from my business, and
much may be seen in that time. As to the number of
passengers, every steamer carries its full complement.
At any rate, you are going, so think no more of your
doubts. You will probably forget that you had any."</p>

<p>So it was that at seven o'clock on the morning of the
fifth of February, when the steamship Moltke left her
dock at New York, we stood among the passengers
lined along her rail. The hawsers had been cast off,
whistles were blowing, and tugs were puffing in their
efforts to push and pull the huge vessel into the stream.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>At that early hour of a wintry day there was no crowd
filling the pier, no sea of faces looking upward, no waving
of handkerchiefs and flags, the usual sight when a
great liner departs. The wharf, cheerless and dismal,
appeared to be almost deserted. Its only occupants
were a few scattered onlookers shivering in the cold,
and the officials and employees whose duties required
their presence. But on the Moltke, in spite of the chill
air and the gray morning, all were animated and eager.
The band played the "Belle of New York" while the
ship was being warped into the stream, and the "American
Patrol" while it was steaming down the river.
The tourists, alert and expectant, viewed the panorama
of the city as the tall buildings were brought into strong
relief against the brightening sky, saw Liberty's cap
reflect the rays of the rising sun, then watched the
incoming steamers, and the forts and lighthouses that
seemed to approach and pass. Just outside of Sandy
Hook our pilot with a satchel of letters descended the
rope ladder to the waiting tug, and soon afterwards the
low-lying shores became dimmer and dimmer until they
disappeared from view.</p>

<p>The farewells had been exchanged on the previous
day, when the promenade decks and saloons of the
steamer were thronged with passengers, friends, and
curious visitors, and the after-deck was encumbered
with piles of baggage. Then, the tables in the main
saloon were filled with boxes of flowers, baskets of
fruit, packages of confectionery, and bundles of steamer
letters marked to be opened on certain days after sailing.</p>

<p>Before the departure we had met the deck steward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
and with his assistance had located our steamer chairs;
for in the places then selected the chairs were to remain
throughout the long cruise. We had also interviewed
the chief steward, had obtained from him a passenger
list, and had arranged that our party should be seated
together at one of the side tables in the dining saloon.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img class="bbox" src="images/illus010.jpg" width="600" height="353" alt="AT THE HOUR OF AFTERNOON TEA." title="AT THE HOUR OF AFTERNOON TEA." />
<span class="caption">AT THE HOUR OF AFTERNOON TEA.</span>
</div>

<p>The passenger list contained four hundred and fifty-three
names. Among these were thirteen preceded by
the title Reverend, thirteen by Doctor, and a number
by military or other titles of honor. Every state in
the Union and several provinces of Canada had representatives
on the list.</p>

<p>During the first three days' sailing a storm, which had
been predicted as approaching from the west when we
left New York, followed but did not overtake us. We
could not, however, remain on deck as long as desired,
for the wind was chilly and the ocean rough. But
each morning, laden with heavy wraps and rugs, we
sought our steamer chairs. Then, settled comfortably
under the wraps and rugs carefully tucked around us
by the attentive steward, we defied the cold for an hour
or two and inhaled the invigorating air.</p>

<p>As the vessel made her way southward, the temperature
moderated and the sea became smooth. By the
time the stormy weather had passed, the tourists,
accustomed to ship motion and ship life, spent most of
their time upon the decks. Then, to increase sociability
and make the time pass pleasantly, self-appointed
committees met and laid plans for card parties, lectures,
concerts, and dances.</p>

<p>On the fifth night out the southern side of the prom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>enade
deck was curtained with awnings, cleared of
chairs, decorated with flags and Chinese lanterns, and
brilliantly illuminated with clusters of electric lights,
for an impromptu dance. Music was furnished by
the band, and Father Neptune kindly kept his waves in
subjection, although an occasional roll caused some
unsteadiness in the movements of the waltzers.</p>

<p>By that time we knew many of our fellow-voyagers.
For, as we had similar plans, a common destination, and
the same pleasures in anticipation, we readily made
friendships. We chatted around the table during the
luncheon and dinner hours, took a hand in euchre with
men in the smoking room, or a place at whist with the
ladies in the music room, and exchanged pleasantries
and experiences with our neighbors while occupying the
steamer chairs. Friendships grew rapidly under these
favorable conditions. Sometimes chats with new acquaintances
which began in a mirthful way changed to
talks of a serious kind as some spoken word recalled
home and friends left behind, and conversations when
prolonged became almost confidential in their character.</p>

<p>One afternoon while we were sipping the tea which
had been served, a lady who occupied a chair next ours,
said:&mdash;"I enjoy so much my hours in the gymnasium.
Each morning I take a gallop on the electric horse and
get my blood into circulation. The first day I felt
rather timid in the saddle when the custodian asked,
'Fast or slow?' so I said, 'Start slow,' but I quickly had
him increase the speed, for I'm used to horseback riding."</p>

<p>"We're from Texas, you know," spoke up a young
woman sitting close by.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>"You should practice riding on the electric camel in
preparation for our trip into Egypt," I suggested.</p>

<p>"We have; we've tried all the arm and foot movements
and have been thumped on the back, and on the
chest, and even on our heads," responded the young
woman. "But I wished for a rowing machine. Rowing
is my favorite exercise."</p>

<p>"Before we left home we all had many misgivings
about this trip," remarked the elder sister. "We
knew how large these steamships really are, but yet
we had visions of many possible discomforts during so
long a journey. We disliked tours in sleeping cars and
couldn't realize the difference between traveling in cars
and in ships. But our stateroom here is very cozy with
the wardrobes and the racks for our books and our
pictures."</p>

<p>"And it seems homelike, too," added the other.</p>

<p>The life on shipboard was to many a novel experience.
In the mornings we were roused from our slumbers by
the notes of a bugle. The first day when the reveille
sounded I looked at my watch. It was a quarter to
eight. "Must I get up?" I thought. Then remembering
that the breakfast hour was from eight to ten, I closed
my eyes. But soon there came a gentle tapping at the
door. "Who's there?" I asked. "Your bath is ready,
sir." The words were English but the accents were
plainly German. That call was more imperative than
the bugler's, for I might miss my invigorating salt water
dip if I did not quickly respond. After a breakfast of
fruit, cereals, chops, and coffee we went to the deck for
a tramp. "Ten rounds of the promenade deck make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
a mile," said my room-mate consulting his pedometer.
Then we strolled to the library for books, but the books
lay unread in our laps when we were seated in our steamer
chairs; for how could our minds be fixed on the story
when the real life before us was more interesting?
The Professor who was to lecture during the trip stepped
by with rapid tread, nodding as he passed. The minister
from Iowa who was to preach on the Sabbath
stopped to exchange greetings, a friend dropped into
a vacant chair for a talk. Then the music stands were
set up and the band assembled around them and for an
hour we listened to selections from Wagner and Bach,
varied with the martial strains of Sousa or the melodies
of Foster. The stewards brought out a table, filled
it with dishes, and served bouillon and biscuit, while
near by a kodak carrier was snapping a picture.</p>

<span class="caption">II. THE BAND WAS PLAYING CARMEN.</span>
</div>

<p>On the ship there were many places of interest.
When in need of exercise we visited the gymnasium on
the upper deck, and when desirous of a change in cooking
we resorted to the grill room where the white clad
cook broiled chops in our sight over a bright fire. Impelled
by curiosity, we explored the vacant steerage, and
with the chief engineer descended the iron ladder to the
depths below to investigate the mysteries of the engine
and fire rooms. Sometimes from the breezy fore-deck
we scanned the horizon for the ships that rarely appeared,
and sometimes sought a snug corner aft and
watched the swift-winged gulls, the quivering log line,
the smoke clouds and their shadows, or the widening
streak of water disturbed by the revolving screw.</p>

<p>"How rapidly the week has passed," said a friend on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
the evening of the twelfth of February. "Listen! One,
two, three, four," as the ship's bell rang out four strokes.
"Four bells, that's six o'clock. We have half an hour
to dress for dinner."</p>

<p>When we entered the brilliantly illuminated dining
saloon that evening a bust of Lincoln was on the platform,
and the room was decorated with the American
colors. Some one had remembered Lincoln's birthday,
though many of the passengers had forgotten the date.
A picture of Lincoln with the inscription, "In commemoration
of President Abraham Lincoln's birthday,"
was engraved on the covers of the souvenir menus.
The dinner was an unusually good one, and the seven
selections rendered by the orchestra during the courses
were appropriate for the day.</p>

<p>After dinner a man who had been personally acquainted
with the martyred President delivered an
interesting memorial address. His final words had just
been said when an announcement was made which
caused a thrill of expectancy and sent us hurriedly to
the deck: "Land is in sight!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="center">FUNCHAL.</p>


<p>"That is the island of Madeira," said the captain,
pointing to a dark mass dimly seen against the
horizon. "We are now nearly twenty-eight hundred
miles southeast of New York."</p>

<p>We had been sailing for seven days with only a vast
expanse of ocean in view, and so we longed for a sight
of land and eagerly looked forward to the arrival at our
first port. As we approached the island the form of a
mountain became clear in the star-light; then the
twinkling of lights at its base revealed the location of a
city. When within half a mile of the shore, the water
in the harbor became too shallow for large vessels, so
the screw propeller of the Moltke ceased revolving and
the ship came to anchor.</p>

<p>"May we go ashore to-night?" many asked.</p>

<p>"Certainly, there is no objection," replied the captain.</p>

<p>A number of the passengers, eager to see the attractions
of the place, and too impatient to wait until
morning, were rowed across the dark water to the pier.
In the city, Funchal, we found that at so late an hour
the main attractions were gambling places, dance halls,
and lotteries, the owners of which were greedy for
American money. The main Casino, in the midst of a
beautiful garden, was brilliantly illuminated and its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
halls were filled with well dressed people. Some of
the party who had placed their silver on the tables of
chance showed on their return to the steamer handfuls
of coins that fortune had brought them; others who
had made similar experiments were silent as to the
results.</p>

<p>"We should have read up the Madeiras before leaving
home," said one of the tourists at our early breakfast
the morning after our arrival, "but we were too busy
then with other things. While you were ashore last
night I found in the library an old English book of
travel that gave some information about the islands."</p>

<p>"I made very few notes," she replied. "As we are to
be in Funchal but one day, I skipped the statistics of
population, hotels, exports, and history. But here
are some facts just as I jotted them down:</p>

<p>"'The Madeira Islands, about six hundred miles west
of Gibraltar, were settled by the Portuguese and are
owned by Portugal.</p>

<p>"'The principal and only town large enough to be
called a city is Funchal, situated on the southern side
of Madeira on the slope of a hill.</p>

<p>"'The city has an equable climate. Mild sunshine,
gentle ocean breezes, and protection from harsh winds
by mountains, give to Funchal throughout the whole
year the temperature of England in the month of May.</p>

<p>"'The island is very mountainous, gashed with many
deep gorges which extend in from the sea. The streets
in the city are paved, but the roads in the country are
impassable for wagons. Merchandise is carried on
pack mules or in ox-drags. Horses are rarely seen and
carriages are few. Quaint vehicles are used in their
stead for the conveyance of passengers.'</p>

<p>"How odd these vehicles are we shall find out when
we land. We shall have a busy day. I am eager to
start."</p>

<p>It was yet early when we ascended the deck, but the
sun was shining brightly. Funchal appeared like a
beautiful picture. Overhead was the azure sky of a
summer day; before us, stirred by a gentle breeze,
glistened in blue and silver the waters of the harbor;
on the curving shore, tier above tier, reflecting the sunshine,
rose the white and yellow stone buildings of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
city surmounted by roofs of red tiling; above the city,
white cottages amidst a dense foliage of green shrubbery
dotted the steep hillsides, and beyond, but seeming
very near, higher mountains formed a dark and appropriate
background.</p>

<span class="caption">THE WOMEN WERE WASHING CLOTHES.</span>
</div>

<p>"The steam tenders are ready to carry you to the
shore," announced one of the officials, interrupting our
survey of the picture.</p>

<p>We descended the long ladder of fifty steps from the
deck of the steamer to the bobbing barge in the water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
below, and were soon landed on the stone steps of the
breakwater, which, extending out to a picturesque crag,
protects and partially encloses the harbor. There, in
place of cabs, a hundred low sleds with canopy tops and
cushioned seats were in readiness to convey us on a
sight-seeing excursion through the city. This ride
in ox-drags was a novel experience. Each sled was
dragged by two bullocks, driven without reins by loud-voiced
natives who, with frequent yells and prodding
sticks, urged on their teams. The drivers carried bunches
of greasy rags which they occasionally threw underneath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
the sled-runners as a lubricant to diminish the friction
of their movement over the stone-paved streets.</p>

<span class="caption">IN THE SLED READY TO START.</span>
</div>

<p>The sights in the city were strange. The shops on
the narrow streets were plain and unattractive, and the
signs unintelligible. The windows of the lower floors
of the dwellings were grated with iron bars like a prison.
Beneath a bridge over a walled ravine that kept a
rushing stream within bounds in the rainy season, women
washed clothes and spread them on rocks to dry. In
the public square the women carrying water from the
fountain or chatting on the sidewalks appeared to have
little curiosity regarding the visitors in their city, and
the men, lounging on the steps of the fountain, cast but
careless glances in our direction; only the boys stopped
their play to gaze awhile at the passing strangers.</p>

<p>"This plodding team seems fitting in such a peculiar
place," remarked one of the quartet in our sled. "Although
it is not rapid transit, it is comfortable. But
look, there is a more luxurious mode of traveling."
As he spoke he pointed to two Portuguese bearing
suspended on a pole a handsome hammock in which
a lady reclined languidly.</p>

<p>At the foot of the mountain we changed from the
slowly moving sleds to the car of a cog-wheel railway,
which carried us up the steep incline. The speed of the
car was not much greater than that of the ox-team. As
we ascended, scenes of beauty opened around us. Cottages
built on terraces were covered with blooming bouguain-villea
or climbing roses. Patches of cultivated land
were filled with sugar cane, banana plants, and orange
trees. Palms and cacti appeared in many varieties.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
Flowers bloomed on every side. Geraniums, fuschias,
and heliotropes were of enormous size. Camelias, lilies,
and nasturtiums grew in profusion. Children from the
suburban cottages ran alongside the moving car, merrily
casting roses, heliotropes, geraniums, and camelias
through the open windows into our laps, and the tourists,
pleased with the floral offerings, in return tossed pennies
to the running children.</p>

<p>When we alighted from the car, young peddlers, some
bright-faced and clean, others ugly and dirty, offered
flowers and trinkets for sale and beggars asked for money.
But our pennies were exhausted and we were glad that
peddlers and paupers were not permitted to follow us
into the hotel grounds.</p>

<p>"Here you may lunch," said the guide, as we entered
a hotel on the mountain, "and get pure Madeira wine.
The wine which is made in this island was at one time
its most noted production; but some thirty years ago
insects and disease so infested the vines that many
vineyards were destroyed and the quantity of wine now
made is not so large as in former years."</p>

<p>After having luncheon and tasting the well known
wine in its purity on a broad piazza overlooking a beautiful
tropical garden, we wandered through an interesting
old church and convent near by, and then strolled
around a mountain pathway from which, as the guide
said, "views most grand" might be seen. As we
advanced on our way we looked down from the height
upon many continually changing scenes of picturesque
beauty. Now there appeared a vista through a wooded
ravine of striking grandeur, now a view of a rocky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
gorge penetrating from the ocean, and again a wide
panorama of city, harbor, and ocean.</p>

</div>

<p>Our return to the city was in a conveyance indeed
unique. The descent of the mountain in sleds from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
summit to the city below, through narrow lanes paved
with small stones worn and slippery from years of
service, was an experience long to be remembered.
Our sled, without any means of propulsion but our own
weight, glided rapidly down the hill over the smooth
surface of the pavement like a toboggan on an icy slide.
It was controlled by two men, who, sometimes running
alongside, sometimes clinging to the runners, regulated
the speed and guided the sled around corners by means
of ropes attached to its sides.</p>

<p>"That was a wild and exciting ride," exclaimed one
of the ladies who had been tightly holding to her seat
during the descent. "What is the distance from the
summit?"</p>

<p>"The slide is about two miles in length, lady," replied
one of the conductors.</p>

<p>"Don't take our picture now with our hair flying
wildly," exclaimed an occupant of a sled just arriving,
to a friend with a camera.</p>

<p>"Your request comes too late," he answered. "I
have pressed the button."</p>

<p>"I hope it will not be a good one," she wished, but
it was.</p>

<p>When we returned to the Moltke many row-boats were
clustered around the vessel. Some of these had brought
visitors who desired to inspect the ship. Some contained
Portuguese merchants, who, with cargoes of embroidery,
wicker chairs, straw goods, fruits, photographs, and
curios, had been patiently awaiting our return. When
they were permitted to come on board they displayed
their wares upon the deck and made many sales. Other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
small craft contained half-naked boys who shouted to
us to test their skill as divers by throwing pennies into
the clear but deep emerald water, claiming that they
could secure the money before it reached the bottom
of the bay. We complied with the boys' request and
exhausted the ship's supply of pennies in putting their
dexterity to the proof. When the money was thrown
into the sea the young experts, diving like beavers and
successful in securing the money, rose to the surface
and clambered into the boats holding the coins in their
mouths. One youth more daring than the others
mounted to the upper deck of our steamer and offered,
if a shilling instead of a penny was thrown into the water,
to plunge from his high perch to the sea fifty feet below
and get the silver. And he won much applause by
successfully accomplishing the feat.</p>

<p>Toward evening the whistle of the steamer sounded
warning notes. The time for sailing was at hand.
The tourists who had been loitering on the shore hastened
to return. The peddlers on the deck reluctantly
packed their unsold wares and with their bundles descended
the ship's ladder. The visitors, after courteously
bidding adieu to the officials who had been entertaining
them, took their departure. But the trained
swimmers whose antics in the water were giving so
much amusement tarried until ordered away. Then
while our band played a farewell air, Sousa's "Hands
Across the Sea," the Moltke slowly steamed out of the
harbor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="center">GIBRALTAR.</p>


<p>"Is not this a German vessel?" asked a passenger of
the first officer, as they stood conversing near the
gymnasium on the upper deck the morning after
we left Funchal.</p>

<p>"Most surely it is," he replied, astonished at the
question.</p>

<p>"Then," pointing to the red ensign floating at the top
of the foremast, "why does the Moltke fly the British
colors?"</p>

<p>"The British flag at our foremast indicates that this
ship is bound for a port that belongs to Great Britain,"
explained the mate. "When we sail from Gibraltar
the Union Jack will be replaced by the French tri-color
to show that we are then on the way to a French port.
The emblem on the fore-mast will be changed many
times before we return to New York. But there,"
turning and pointing to the rear, "in its place at the
stern is the German standard, the flag of our fatherland.
There it will remain throughout the cruise. Above us,
too, on the mast nearest the stern, the white pennant
bearing the letters H. A. P. A. G., the insignia of the
company that owns the Moltke, will constantly fly."</p>

<p>The evening we sailed from Funchal each lady found
beside her plate at the dinner table a bunch of violets,
a memento from the flower gardens of Madeira; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
on St. Valentine's Day each found there a package
containing a pretty fan with the compliments of the
Captain. At this dinner on the fourteenth of February
much merriment prevailed during the dessert course,
when favors containing caps and bonnets were distributed.
Formality was dropped for the time. Each
diner donned his headgear and the comical appearance
of the wearers drew forth many pleasantries and much
laughter.</p>

<p>The Captain, with a huge paper sun-bonnet on his
head, rose to make a few remarks.</p>

<p>"Silence! listen to what our old mother has to say!"
cried a humorist.</p>

<p>Amid laughter the captain began, but the laughter
quickly ceased and his words were listened to with
attention.</p>

<p>"Fellow voyagers," said he in conclusion, "you will
find on the bulletin board to-night some information and
advice relative to your trip to Granada. For the past
ten days you have been under my charge and I have
looked after your welfare, but to-morrow you leave the
vessel for two days. I wish you a pleasant excursion
and a safe return to shelter under the care of your 'Old
Mother.'"</p>

<p>After the applause had subsided and a response had
been made by one of the passengers, the orchestra
played as a finale Liebe's "Auf Wiedersehen."</p>

<p>Then we, after securing pencil and paper, hastened to
join the crowd around the bulletin board to make notes
of the directions for the trip into Spain. The notice
read as follows:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>"The Moltke will arrive at Gibraltar to-morrow,
February fifteenth, before daylight. Breakfast will
be served at an early hour and tenders will be alongside
the steamer at seven o'clock to take the
tourists to the dock. There guides will be in waiting
and three hours will be spent in Gibraltar.</p>

<p>"At ten o'clock the tourists will be conveyed in
the steam ferry across the bay to the railroad station
at Algeciras, from which place the train will start
for Granada. During the ferry passage a box containing
luncheon to be eaten on the train will be
given to each person.</p>

<p>"Dress warmly or take heavy wraps, as it is sometimes
cold at Granada at this season of the year.</p>

<p>"Call at the office at the news-stand on main
deck for railroad tickets and hotel assignments.</p>

<p>"The excursion party returning will leave
Granada at four o'clock Monday afternoon and
arrive at the steamer about midnight. The
Moltke will then sail for Algiers."</p></blockquote>

<p>"Let us go to the office at once. The giving out of
tickets may require considerable time," said my room-mate.</p>

<p>Others were of the same opinion, it seemed, for many
were ahead of us, but there was no delay, each applicant
receiving promptly with his railroad ticket a card bearing
the name of the hotel in Granada to which he was
assigned. The managers of the tour, having arranged
in advance for the required number of rooms at the
principal hotels, were prepared to make the allotment
before leaving the vessel, so avoiding confusion and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
delay on our arrival at our destination, and securing
for us prompt attention at the hotels.</p>

<p>Some of our friends who had already received their
envelopes rejoiced to see on their cards "Hotel Washington
Irving," a hotel which they knew from description
to be beautifully situated on the heights near the
Alhambra.</p>

<p>"Hotel Victoria," I read on mine. I was disappointed
at first, but on the following day I found that
the central location of the "Victoria" gave opportunities
to see much of the life of the city that might have
been missed had the assignment been to the hotel in
the suburbs.</p>

<p>When we awoke the next morning the Moltke was
lying quietly at anchor. We hastily dressed and
ascended to the deck.</p>

<p>Any one who has seen pictures of the huge rock that
guards the entrance to the Mediterranean will recognize
Gibraltar at sight if he approaches the rock from the
right point of view. The illustrations, however, represent
a somber mountain. The picture we saw showed
white houses, red roofs, green trees, patches of lawn,
groups of shrubbery, and plots of flowers, all contrasting
with gray rocks; these with blue sky overhead, and
white sails in the foreground gave life and color to the
scene.</p>

<p>As we gazed for some time from the vessel's deck at
the strong fortress which has been held securely in the
grasp of Great Britain for two hundred years, we
thought of the many unsuccessful attempts that have
been made during those two centuries to wrest it from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>British control; most noted of all, the long siege by the
French and Spanish forces that continued for four years
when Napoleon was supreme in France. What might
have been the result, if England's grasp on the rock
had been broken by Napoleon; or what the outcome,
if Napoleon's fleet had been victorious in the conflict
on the near-by Trafalgar Bay!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img class="bbox" src="images/illus036.jpg" width="300" height="437" alt="THE ROCK HAD A PEACEFUL LOOK." title="THE ROCK HAD A PEACEFUL LOOK." />
<span class="caption">THE ROCK HAD A PEACEFUL LOOK.</span>
</div>

<p>The rock had a peaceful look, but we knew that the
cactus plants, which grew rank on the slope of the
mountain, concealed powerful batteries, and that on the
summit of the rock were mounted cannons of the largest
calibre, which, if required, could hurl projectiles to the
far side of the strait, a distance of twelve miles.</p>

<p>On one of the highest points of the rock stands the
Signal Tower. To this tower the officers of the Moltke
had signaled the news of our arrival when the steamer
entered the harbor, and before we had stirred from our
berths, that information had been flashed over the cable
to London and New York. On the following morning
our friends at home read in the shipping news of their
daily paper, the following item:</p>

<p>"Arrived out; Feb. 15, Gibraltar, Moltke, from New
York."</p>

<p>As we started ashore on the lighters at the early hour
appointed, we realized that we should have to take in a
great deal in a very little while. We entered the city
of Gibraltar by a tunnel-like entrance through walls of
great thickness. The gateway was closely guarded by
sentinels, who demanded the passes with which we had
been furnished and who told us that these would be
good only until sunset, for at the firing of the evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
gun each day the gates are closed and the passes then are
useless.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 280px;">

<span class="caption">WE DESCENDED A LONG LADDER OF FIFTY STEPS.</span>
</div><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>The markets near the gates, where many kinds of
fruits, vegetables, and fish, unlike those seen in our
home markets, were offered for sale, first attracted our
attention. Here customers carrying oddly shaped
baskets were bargaining with Moorish fishermen,
Jewish peddlers, and Spanish marketmen. Each dealer,
with gesticulations and loud voice, appeared to be
asserting the superiority of his own wares. There was a
confusion of tongues. Only the pigs tied to stakes
squealed, and the chickens in wicker crates crowed,
in strains familiar to our ears. The streets through
which we proceeded were clean but narrow. The sidewalks
were only wide enough for two people to walk
side by side. The buildings were constructed of gray
limestone similar to that of which the great Rock is
composed.</p>

<p>The presence of an army in this stronghold was indicated
by the large number of soldiers we met. An
officer whom we questioned kindly told us that the
garrison consisted of about six thousand men, and that
provisions sufficient to feed that number for five years
in case of siege were at all times kept in storage. He
advised us to visit the "Lower Galleries" of the fortifications
on the heights and obtain the view from that
point, and then to attend the afternoon band concert
in the park. But our limited stay did not permit us to
follow his suggestions.</p>

<p>"In some respects," said the Major, "Gibraltar is
rather a dull post for the officers stationed here; but
we have a large library, billiard and club rooms, courts
for tennis, and ground for polo. We have also many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
dances and riding parties, and occasionally attend the
Spanish bull fights which take place in the large bull
ring across the bay at Algeciras."</p>

<span class="caption">WALLS OF GREAT THICKNESS AND A TUNNEL-LIKE ENTRANCE.</span>

<p>The great variety of uniforms worn by the soldiers of
England was particularly noticeable. We saw squads
in khaki uniforms carrying quarters of beef toward the
barrack buildings on the hill; a detachment in Scotch
kilts marching to
relieve the guards
on sentinel duty
at the neutral
ground; many
smart looking
corporals and sergeants
in short
red jackets and
little red caps
placed jauntily on
the sides of their
heads, carrying
short canes; an
elderly looking
officer in spotless
white flannel, to
whom the military
salute was
given by all soldiers who passed him; numbers of
officers in red coats and white duck trousers; and a
group of troopers in undress uniform of coarse white or
grey, who had been grooming the horses in the stables.</p>

<p>Other things of interest that the camera of our eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
snapped as we hurried along, were yellow-slippered,
bare-legged, swarthy Arabs gliding quietly by; a neat
grey-gowned nurse taking two pretty English children
to early service; Spaniards in long black cloaks and
felt hats drawn down, who looked exactly like the
conspirators we see in a play; many sailors in the garb
of various nations, who appeared to be enjoying a holiday
ashore; Hebrew residents in peculiar looking coarse
costumes; well dressed English people with prayer
books on their way to church; Moors from Tangiers in
snow-white turbans, and black-haired Spanish señoritas
with large pompadours, high combs, and mantillas
draped gracefully over their heads. These, with many
others, met our sight; but, among all the crowd we
encountered, we were not approached by a beggar, the
soliciting of alms being forbidden by the military
authorities.</p>

<p>We paused to glance at the little Trafalgar cemetery,
but did not enter.</p>

<p>"Here," said the English guide, "sleep many of the
British heroes who with our gallant Nelson gave their
lives to gain the famous naval victory of the Bay of
Trafalgar, in which the French and Spanish fleets were
destroyed. Bonaparte boasted that the combined
navies of the two countries would crush our British
fleet, and then his army would cross the channel and
camp in London; but our brave Admiral upset Napoleon's
plans."</p>

<p>Beyond the cemetery we crossed the Alameda or
Park Gardens, the pleasure ground of the people, where
the military band plays in the afternoon and evening.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
There we saw a luxuriant growth of subtropical vegetation,
orange trees with leaves of dark, glossy green,
date palms with bunches of unripe dates, palms with
broad leaves, spreading pepper trees, and great ash
trees whose roots protruded above the ground for unwary
tourists to stumble over. The geraniums and heliotropes
were of gigantic size, and many other flowering
plants were unusually large.</p>

</div>

<p>Our guide persuaded us to enter a museum, as he
called it; but this proved to be a regular old curiosity
shop containing a large assortment of oddities and
souvenirs with which the owner was willing to part for
a sufficient compensation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>"There is a little milkmaid serving milk. I'll take a
snap-shot of her while she is at work," said one of our
party with a camera as we drew near a young girl who
was drawing milk directly from a brown-haired goat into
a customer's pitcher.</p>

<p>While returning to the wharf we met several herds of
the brown-haired goats driven by milkmen through the
streets; and, assembled near the dock around a group
of English Salvation Army lads and lasses who were
singing familiar hymns accompanied by cornet and
drum, we saw a motley crowd of men, many of whom
from their diverse and peculiar costumes were evidently
sailors from various ports of the world. Then, having
completed our hurried tramp through the city in the
time allotted for that purpose, we descended the steps
at the pier to the ferry-boat that was to carry us a few
miles across the bay to the town of Algeciras.</p>

<p>After thirty minutes on the ferry we stepped ashore
on Spanish soil. The first special train had departed
and the second was being made up. During the short
interval of waiting, the kodak carriers were busily
engaged securing their first Spanish views.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>The small cars on the railroad which carried us
from Algeciras to Granada were divided into
compartments with doors opening from the sides.
Each compartment comfortably seated eight persons,
four facing the front and four the rear. This arrangement
of seating allows general conversation among the
group, and, if the occupants are congenial, promotes
sociability.</p>

<p>A traveler speeding through the United States in a
"Chicago Limited," at the rate of sixty miles an hour,
can merely catch glimpses of objects on the way and
receive only blurred and indistinct impressions of the
scenery; but when traveling in the "Spanish Express,"
at the more moderate speed of twenty-five miles an hour,
he can enjoy clear and vivid pictures of the unfolding
panorama. Let me try to describe some of these
pictures just as they appeared to us during the trip.</p>

<p>Looking back after leaving Algeciras, we saw the huge
rock of Gibraltar, almost an island, connected with the
main land by a narrow, flat, sandy isthmus. Across
the "neutral ground," as the strip between the English
and Spanish possessions is called, a line of sentry boxes
extended, and red-coated British sentinels paced back
and forth. Parallel to the British line there was another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
line of sentry boxes, where the soldiers of Alfonzo were
on guard to prevent the smuggling of tobacco and other
forbidden wares into Spain.</p>

<p>"See those miserable little white plastered huts with
roofs made of straw," said one of our party. "I did not
know that the people were so poor."</p>

<p>This picture of poverty was our first impression of
Spain. For some distance the train had been running
through a region apparently unfertile, where fences of
sharp spined cacti enclosed small fields. The people
were shabbily dressed, the houses straw-thatched and
dilapidated, and the little patches of land poorly cultivated.
It seemed that Sunday was a common wash-day;
for at almost every cottage the family wash was
hanging in the sun on trees, shrubs, or cacti.</p>

<p>Within an hour, however, we were passing through a
section of the country entirely different in aspect, where
the cork industry gives employment to many people.
For a distance of eight or ten miles groves of cork-oak
trees were in sight. At the station were bulky piles of
cork bark, cars stacked with cork were on the sidings,
and great carts drawn by oxen were on the roads bringing
in still more of this valuable commodity.</p>

<p>"Millions of bottles are made in our city," said a New
Jersey girl, "and there is enough cork here in sight to
stopper them all."</p>

<p>Beyond this, the land was more fertile and under
better cultivation. Well built stone houses replaced
the huts; glossy-leaved orange trees and pink-blossomed
almond trees dotted the fields or filled the orchards.
Instead of fences, the boundaries of fields and farms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
were marked at the corners by white stones projecting
above the ground. Farther along, yellow-green olive
plantations, magnificent in size and beautiful in color,
filling the valleys and hillsides as far as the eye could see
with orderly, far-reaching lines of trees, made so impressive
a sight that it drew forth many expressions of
admiration.</p>

<span class="caption">SPANISH CHILDREN CAME TO THE STATION.</span>
</div>

<p>Women, as gatekeepers, waved white flags to signal
that the crossings were clear. Gangs of men, often
thirty in a gang, were in the fields cultivating leeks
or onions with crude, heavy-looking, short-handled hoes.
Teams of long-horned oxen attached to old-fashioned
plows, at times eight or ten teams in one field, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
turning up the soil. Occasionally ox-teams drawing
heavily laden carts or wagons were seen along the smooth
white roads; but more frequently appeared trains of
slowly moving donkeys, five or six in a line, with gay
trappings and bells and panniers piled high with produce,
driven by red-sashed muleteers.</p>

<p>At stations where the train stopped five or ten minutes,
the doors at the sides of the compartments were opened
and the passengers descended and walked up and down
the platform. Spanish women, carrying jugs, cried
"Lacte," "Limonada," "Narrandjada," and "Acqua,"
and other peddlers with baskets offered "bollos,"
"tortitas," and "narranges." After some difficulties in
obtaining information as to "how much," the shillings
and pence, pesetas and centimes of the tourists were
exchanged for the milk, lemonade, orangeade, and
water, the cakes, rolls, and oranges of the dealers.</p>

<p>One of the ladies, after making a purchase, said, "I
asked that woman with the black-eyed baby the price
of a half dozen oranges. She said, 'Fifty centimes.'
Then I offered her an English six-pence, and she gave
me six oranges and a penny in change."</p>

<p>Spanish boys scrambled for a roll or boiled eggs thrown
to them, and men, women, and children extended their
hands for money or remnants of our luncheon. One
boy who had secured an apple and an egg in a scramble
laughed with happiness over his success. These people
did not appear to be destitute; for children, as well as
adults, were comfortably clothed, and wore neat looking
shoes and stockings. As the day, however, was Sunday,
probably they were in holiday attire.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>The red-capped station masters were important
personages. At the principal stations they directed
the starting of the trains with the greatest care and
deliberation. In our own country the conductor's hand
touches the signal-cord and the train moves. At
Ronda, a bell in the station rang, then a red-capped
employee trotted along the
length of the train ringing a
hand dinner bell. A minute
later he repeated his trip with
warning bell, then the whistle
tooted, but it was not until
the red-cap was sure that
every passenger was aboard
that the whistle issued a second
toot and the wheels began to
revolve. These extraordinary
precautions, although affording
amusement for the
tourists, may have been
taken under special orders of
the railroad officials in order
to avoid accidents and
insure our safety. At any
rate, we know that the railroad
officials and their Spanish employees did give us
special attention and treat us with kindness and
courtesy.</p>

<p>Through many deep cuts and tunnels, over romantic
gorges of dark depth, and along cliffs whose heights
we could not see, the train climbed and crossed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
mountain range. As the car emerged from tunnel or
cut, changing scenes of wild and savage landscape appeared
near by, and charming glimpses of distant valleys
far below. The torrents and waterfalls of the river
Gaudiara added to the weird beauty of the scene.
A stanza in Southey's poem, "The Cataract of Lodore,"
fittingly describes the wildness of the river that we
crossed and re-crossed so often:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">"Here it comes sparkling<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And there it lies darkling:<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Now smoking and frothing<br /></span>
<span class="i8">The cataract strong<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Then plunges along,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dashing and flashing and splashing and clashing:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so never ending but ever descending,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sound and motions forever are blending."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A famous canyon, deep and narrow, with rushing,
foaming stream, seemed like a crevice sliced down by a
gigantic blade. Towns and villages far away amid
green fields and gray olive orchards, and buildings
of white and cream, luminous in the sunlight, with
backgrounds of dark and rugged mountains, produced
a succession of picturesque views. Among the hills
were seen young Davids, staff in hand, guarding flocks
of grazing sheep, ancient swineherds lazily watching
droves of swine feeding on the roots, and goatherds
following their nimble-footed brown herds as they
picked their way among the rocks.</p>

<p>As we approached our destination, the valleys showed
signs of great prosperity. The fields were highly cultivated;
the farms were irrigated by ditches of flowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
water; the orchards were well trimmed; the buildings
larger; and the red-sashed laborers more sprucely
attired.</p>

<p>At Pinos we saw the stone bridge where, in 1492,
Columbus, on his way to France, disheartened by his
failure to interest King Ferdinand in his plans, was over-taken
by Queen Isabella's messenger and summoned
back to court to receive his commission.</p>

<p>As twilight was settling down we arrived on schedule
time at the white stone station in Granada where carriages
stood in waiting to convey us to the hotels. The
Spanish drivers strove to surpass each other in speed.
Our coachman lashed his horses till they ran like a run-away
team. Regardless of anyone in the streets, grazing
wagons by the way, overtaking and passing carriages
ahead, he gave us the wildest ride we had ever taken.
This chariot race to the hotel, a distance of over a mile,
happily ended without accident or collision.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm thankful that ride is over without an
upset," exclaimed with a sigh of relief a nervous lady,
who had tried ineffectually to restrain the driver's
zeal by the use of English words which he did not understand.</p>

<p>The old Cathedral, covering ground equal to a block
in length and half a block in width, always attracts
many visitors. Massive pillars support the roof and
marble tiles cover the floor. The light, falling softly
through stained glass windows, discloses valuable
paintings on the walls, fine statuary in the aisles, and
decorations of white and gold.</p>

<p>"Is this building very old?" some one inquired.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>"Old!" replied the guide with scorn in his voice,
"this Cathedral was here when Columbus discovered
your country." The guide, however, exaggerated
somewhat. It was built just about the time America
was discovered.</p>

<span class="caption">HERE WASHINGTON IRVING LIVED FOR A TIME.</span>
</div>

<p>In the Royal Chapel of the Cathedral, upon an
alabaster mausoleum decorated with fine carving, lie
the effigies of Ferdinand and Isabella. The soft,
creamy alabaster gives them the appearance of sleeping.
An inscription on the tomb reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>This chapel was founded by most Catholic Don Fernando
and Dona Isable, King and Queen of Spain, of Naples, of Sicily,
of Jerusalem, who conquered this kingdom and brought it back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
to our Faith; who acquired the Canary Isles and the Indies;
who crushed heresy, and expelled the Moors and Jews from these
realms.</p>

<p>
Queen Dona Isable died Nov. 26, 1504.<br />
King Don Fernando died Jan. 23, 1516.<br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the altar of the chapel is a very interesting bas-relief
representing the surrender of the city of Granada.
In the sacristy we were shown the carefully guarded
holy relics; the richly embroidered vestments used on
ceremonial occasions, the sword of Ferdinand; the
sceptre, crown, and mirror of Isabella; and the casket
which contained the jewels that the Queen offered in
pledge to secure funds for Columbus.</p>

<p>"Most precious of all the relics," said the sacristan,
"is the handkerchief with which the blessed Santa
Veronica wiped the sweat from the Savior's brow on
the road to Calvary. This bears the impression of the
Savior's face."</p>

<p>The greatest point of interest in Granada, perhaps in
all Spain, is, of course, the Alhambra. This is the name
given to a collection of buildings located on an elevation
that overlooks the city. These palaces on the heights
were for many centuries the dwelling places of the
Moorish kings, surrounded by their nobles, retainers,
and guardsmen. They were also the repositories in
which were stored the immense treasure accumulated
from the forays of the Moors upon the Christians of
northern Spain, and from the sacking of Christian cities.
The palaces of the rulers and the treasure within were
protected by great citadels and by stout walls which
encircled the heights.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>In the latter part of the fifteenth century, after a long
struggle, the Moorish power was overthrown by King
Ferdinand, and since then Granada has been a Spanish
city. Columbus was present at the court of the Spanish
sovereign when the capitulation of Granada occurred
in April, 1492, and within two weeks after the surrender
of the city received his commission to sail in search of a
new world.</p>

<p>Washington Irving's description of the entrance of the
conquering Spaniards into the Alhambra after the
capture of the city, might, with the change of a word or
two, still portray the visit of a party of modern tourists.</p>

<p>"The halls lately occupied by turbaned infidels,"
he writes, "now rustled with stately dames and Christian
courtiers, who wandered with eager curiosity over
this far-famed palace, admiring its verdant courts and
gushing fountains, its halls decorated with elegant
arabesques, and storied with inscriptions, and the
splendor of its gilded and brilliantly painted ceilings."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>Although the coloring is faded, and in many places the
intricate ornamentation is crumbling or broken, sufficient
remains to show how marvelously beautiful it must
have been in Moorish splendor. And beautiful it still
is, notwithstanding the ravages of time.</p>

<p>While in the Court of Myrtles, some of the party
examined the light, graceful arches and the stucco
tapestry interwoven with flowers and leaves that adorn
the galleries; others were more interested in the gold
fish swimming in the transparent water of the long
sunken tank in the center of the tiled court. In the
richly ornamented Hall of the Ambassadors, the state
reception room of the king, we waited while the guide,
in answer to a request, interpreted some of the delicately
carved inscriptions that fill every available space on the
wall.</p>

<p>"One of these mottoes," said the guide, "that is
repeated over and over again on almost every wall of the
palace, reads: 'There is no conqueror but Allah.'
Other mottoes which are very common are: 'There is no
God but Allah;' 'Mohammed is the envoy of Allah;'
'Allah is great;' 'Allah never forgets;' and various
quotations from the Koran."</p>

<p>Twelve weatherbeaten marble lions in the center of
the Court of Lions uphold a large alabaster basin in
which were caught, in times gone by, the falling waters
of the fountain above it. Many graceful pillars support
the surrounding arcades of this court and the exquisite
fret-work looks as if carved in ivory.</p>

<p>A practical man in the party called attention to the
beautiful wooden doors through which we entered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
Hall of the Abencerrages, and to the peculiar manner
in which they were hung on pivots instead of hinges.
On the rim of the marble basin in the center of this hall
some red stains were seen.</p>

<p>"Here," said our guide, "is where the heads of the
Abencerrages were cut off.</p>

<p>"But why was Aben's head cut off?" inquired a lady.</p>

<p>This gave the guide the opportunity he desired.</p>

<p>"A prominent member of the tribe or family of the
Abencerrages, named Hamet," he replied, "fell in love
with the Sultana, and she in return loved the handsome
and gallant warrior. Secret meetings took place under
a cypress tree in the garden of the Generalife until the
Sultan, Boabdil, accidentally discovered their meetings.
The enraged Boabdil, without revealing his knowledge
of their actions, invited the guilty Hamet and every
member of his tribe to attend a banquet. As each guest
arrived at the palace he was brought into this hall.
Here the guards seized him, forced his head over the
edge of this basin, and the sharp simitar of the executioner
showed no mercy. This was the king's revenge,
and so the stains on the fountain."</p>

<p>The Room of Two Sisters brought forth exclamations
of praise. Walls covered with dainty traceries in plaster,
like embroideries on a ground of lace work; dados
brilliant in fantastic designs of red, green, and blue;
ceilings dropping thousands of stalactites each differing
from the others in beauty of form; and charming views
from the boudoir windows of floral beds and fountains
in the garden beyond,&mdash;all these combined to make
this place a suitable residence for a Queen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Baths we saw where royalty had bathed in
marble basins to the sound of music by players in the
gallery overhead.</p>

<p>"Here are the rooms which Washington Irving occupied
in the Alhambra during his stay in Granada,"
explained the guide.</p>

<p>Some of us tried to recall Irving's graphic descriptions
in the "Conquest of Granada" of the scenes around
this city; of the struggles between the Christian knights
under the banner of Ferdinand, and the Moorish cavaliers
under the standard of Mahomet; of fields covered
with silken canopies; of cavalcades of warriors in
jeweled armor and nodding plumes; of hand-to-hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
conflicts and daring exploits; of the siege and capture
of the city and expulsion of the Moors from Spain.
As we thought of the unfortunate Boabdil, the noble
queen mother Ayxa, and the beautiful Zoraya, driven
into exile, giving up their beloved palace, the home of
their ancestors with all its wealth and beauty, to their
hated enemies, and leaving the land which had been in
possession of the Moors for eight centuries, we to some
extent realized the sorrow that filled the hearts of the
departing exiles as they looked back for the last time
on the heights of Granada and wept.</p>

<p>Although the buildings of the Alhambra are partly
in ruins, the view from the Old Watch Tower has not
changed materially. Standing on the tiled roof to which
we climbed by many well worn stone steps, we saw a
magnificent panorama spread out before us. The city
lay almost at our feet; beautiful valleys extended for
many miles dotted with white villages; gray olive
orchards appeared here and there; verdant hills rose
in the distance; and, forty miles away, the snow-covered
peaks of the Sierra Nevada pierced the sky.</p>

<p>After leaving the tower, we drove to the Palace of the
Generalife, which is situated on the mountain side
considerably higher than the Alhambra. We approached
this beautifully located residence, where Moorish kings
came to spend the summer months, by a wide path
bordered with tall cypress trees. In the Court of the
Cypresses our Spanish guide pointed to a venerable tree
and said: "That cypress is six hundred years old;
under it the guilty lovers, the Queen and Hamet,
had their meetings until discovered by King Boabdil."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>In the gardens of the Generalife, we rambled amid
oddly trimmed trees, climbing roses, immense rose
bushes, fountains, and grottoes, and wished that our
stay might be prolonged. The terraces of the garden
have flights of marble steps leading from one level to
another. One of the flights we descended had runlets
of water flowing down on the top of the marble balustrades.
Water, clear and sparkling, which is brought
from a mountain stream above, is abundant everywhere
in fountains and pools, and in streamlets along the pathways.</p>

<p>Among the sights of the city the milk delivery was
interesting to strangers. A number of long-haired
brown goats having been driven to the door of a house,
a pitcher was brought and the milk drawn fresh from one
of the goats; or a cow was led along the street and the
milk furnished directly from the cow in any quantity
desired by the customer.</p>

<p>Small donkeys with panniers were used instead of
wagons for the transfer of almost every kind of material
in the city and country. Often the burdens were so
large that the donkey was almost lost from sight. We
saw these patient little animals driven through the
streets variously laden with sacks of charcoal, bundles
of wood, baskets of vegetables, crates of oranges, bags
of coal, cans of water, kegs of wine, or bearing hampers
filled with building stone, bright tinware, or new-mown
grass. Even the street cleaners shoveled into the
panniers on the donkeys' backs the dirt and refuse that
had been collected on the streets. Occasionally we saw
men or women or children perched on the top of a load.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
Two men were sometimes seen riding on one donkey,
and once we observed three large men on one small
donkey.</p>

<p>As we drove along the streets to the station the residents
at doors, windows, and sidewalks smilingly commented
among themselves on our outlandish foreign
costumes, evidently comparing our American styles
with their own familiar dress. It was certainly as
interesting to the Spanish women to observe the peculiarities
of our costumes as it was for us to notice the
mantillas and gay bodices which gave them a picturesque
appearance in our eyes. We were being inspected
as well as they; but the Spaniards are so polite
that there was nothing unpleasant in their curiosity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>It was after midnight when the steam launches carried
us across the bay from Algeciras to our steamship.
The reception given us at the Moltke, after our two
days' absence, made us feel that we had indeed arrived
home. Colored fires reddened the waters, clusters of
electric lights illumined the sides of the vessel, the band
was playing on deck, and the captain welcomed us at
the head of the gangway. Then while the orchestra
played selections, a full course midnight dinner was
served to the hungry pilgrims.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">THE CITY OF ALGIERS.</p>


<p>On the morning of Tuesday, February seventeenth,
the Moltke was speeding over a calm sea toward
the coast of Africa. The tourists, after the
strenuous sight-seeing of the past two days, luxuriously
rested. Some lazily lounged in steamer chairs with pillows
under their heads and gay blankets over them;
others exchanged experiences with friends while sauntering
slowly around the deck. Some in groups surrounded
the card tables, playing or watching the
games; while others read books from the shelves of the
library, or gathered the latest home news from the
columns of the London Times, or the Paris edition of
the New York Herald, copies of which had been taken
on board at Gibraltar.</p>

<p>During the afternoon, however, a north-east wind
suddenly arose which stirred the blue waters of the
Mediterranean until the short choppy waves gave to
the vessel a new and peculiar roll, differing from any
previously experienced by those on board. As a result,
many of the passengers, not being able to adjust themselves
to this unfamiliar change of motion, became
suddenly pale, and prudently retired to the privacy of
their staterooms. But by the time the evening dinner
was served the wind had somewhat subsided, and the
majority of the passengers gathered in the saloon for an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
entertainment in the form of a roll-call of states. This
was presided over in a jolly manner by a prominent
lawyer from Philadelphia. As he called the name of a
state, some native of that state responded in a short
informal address in which he praised his section of the
country so highly that he made it appear to be a perfect
El Dorado. There was but time to hear from seventeen
states although representatives from almost every state
in the Union and from Canada were present.</p>

<p>When the sun rose on Wednesday morning our steamer
was anchored within the breakwater a short distance
from the docks in the harbor of Algiers. A pleasant
sight greeted our eyes when we came on deck. We saw
a little white boat gliding over the waves flying the
American flag, then two white steam launches speeding
through the harbor with the same emblem floating in the
breeze, while, over to the left, we descried at anchor
three white gun boats, and hanging at their sterns our
country's flag.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>"Three cheers for the Stars and Stripes," cried an
enthusiast, and the hurrahs were given earnestly and
vigorously.</p>

<p>On the bulletin board we found the following notice
posted:</p>

<blockquote><p class="center">PROGRAM FOR ALGIERS.</p>

<p>The Managers will furnish landing tickets to the tourists
but all expenses while on shore in Algiers will be borne by each
individual.</p>

<p>Carriages will be waiting on the docks for those who desire
to ride, at their own expense, and a guide will be assigned to go
with every four carriages.</p>

<p>Meals may be obtained by returning to the ship, and passengers
are expected to return to the vessel at night.</p></blockquote>

<p>"How shall we spend the day without a definite plan
laid out for us?" said one of a group at the bulletin
board.</p>

<p>"Let us take carriages with a guide as interpreter,"
suggested another, "and drive around the city during
the morning, then buy our luncheon at a French restaurant,
and spend the afternoon tramping around and
visiting the shops."</p>

<p>"That will suit me, especially the shopping part;
I want to buy some souvenirs," replied a third.</p>

<p>"And return hungry to the vessel in time for a good
dinner in the evening," added a fourth.</p>

<p>Descending the ship's ladder, we placed ourselves in
the care of the bronzed Arab boatmen, whose little boats
had for some time been circling around the steamer, and
were rowed to the custom house pier. Not having
luggage to be examined, we fearlessly passed the red-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>trousered
custom officials in the building and crossed the
busy docks to the carriages in waiting.</p>

</div>

<p>At the docks many vessels were lying, and the wharves
were filled with outgoing and incoming freight. Beyond
the docks along the front of the city is a broad avenue,
the Boulevard de la Republic, elevated forty or fifty
feet above the wharves. This boulevard is supported
on the sea side by solid white stone arcaded walls,
and is reached by inclined roadways or by handsome
stone stairways. On the land side it is lined with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
substantial white stone buildings of uniform height
with an arcade in front.</p>

<p>The population of the city of Algiers, about 100,000,
is composed principally of Moors, Arabs, Negroes,
and other African nationalities, but with a large number
of French, and many Hebrews, some Spanish, English,
and other Continental representatives, and a few Americans.
On its streets we saw faces of different colors
ranging from pure white, through all the tints of brown,
to the deepest black.</p>

<p>In the Place de Gouvernment, one of the centers of
business and religious life of the city, we met turbaned
Arabs, barefoot negroes, red-trousered soldiers, French
civilians, American tourists, Hebrew traders, Kabyle
mountaineers. In this motley crowd the native men
and women especially attracted our attention. The
Algerine men wore long white gowns fastened at the
waist with a girdle; white cloaks, called bournous,
around their shoulders; and white turbans of many
folds on their heads. The richer classes were arrayed
in spotless garments of fine material, stockings, and
ornamented sandals; the laborers wore coarse gowns,
and sandals made of rope; while the unclean bodies of
importunate beggars and unfortunate cripples were but
partially covered with filthy sacking and rags which
hung upon them.</p>

<p>The Mohammedan women, wearing long bloomers
made exceedingly full, and white mantles resembling
sheets draped over their heads and falling loosely around
their bodies, looked like ghosts as they walked through
the streets. The white bandages or veils wrapped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
around their heads concealed all the features except
the eyes, which appeared black and piercing. The
Arab men may be able to distinguish the age of these
veiled females, but it was difficult for us to tell which
were old women, and which young, except by the elasticity
of their movements.</p>

<span class="caption">THE ALGERINE MEN WEAR LONG WHITE GOWNS.</span>
</div>

<p>Near the Place de Gouvernment is the imposing palace
of the Governor where all official business is transacted.
Adjoining the palace stands the handsome Roman
Catholic Cathedral. A long flight of white marble
steps leads up to the doors of the Cathedral and a
spreading palm tree stands like a guard near the foot
of the stairway. As we stood before the tomb of St.
Geronimo in the interior of the Cathedral, we listened to
the following tale told by our Catholic guide.</p>

<p>"A young man by the name of Geronimo, who lived
in Italy about three hundred and fifty years ago, was
captured by the Moors, and because he would not renounce
the Christian religion, was condemned by his
captors to death by torture. They tied his feet and
hands with cords and threw him alive into a mould of
soft concrete which slowly hardened around him, and
the stone thus formed was built into the wall of a fortress
then in course of construction. Fifty years ago, when
the fortress was being demolished, the block of stone was
discovered with the skeleton enclosed therein. The
bones were carefully removed and interred in this Chapel
in the tomb you see before you. Into the vacant space
within the block of concrete, after removal of the bones,
liquid plaster of Paris was poured, as into a mould, and
a perfect model of Geronimo's body was obtained and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
placed in the Museum. It was in recognition of this
act of heroism in refusing to renounce the Christian
faith that the martyr was canonized and the name of
Geronimo was added to the calendar of the saints of
our Church."</p>

<p>In confirmation of the guide's story, the plaster of
Paris model of the dead martyr's body may be seen
among the curiosities and antiquities in the National
Museum, a short distance from the Cathedral. This
model shows the features, the clothing, and the cords
which tied his feet and hands.</p>

<p>The main business part of the city is not only modern
but model, having clean, well paved streets lined with
substantial white stone four-story buildings with arcades
or covered pavements in front of them. As very little
smoke or soot rises from the city the white buildings
have not become soiled and darkened but retain their
freshness and purity of color.</p>

<p>Many of the stores we visited were kept by Arabs who
understood French but could speak only a few words
of English. The prices named by these merchants
were generally two or three times more than they expected
customers to pay, and it was very amusing to
watch the process of a sale. A price was named by the
dealer; a bid was made by the customer; then figuring,
explaining, and dickering went on in a mixture of
languages and signs until finally, if the buyer's patience
did not wear out, the deal closed with a compromise.
When the purchaser departed happy with a bargain,
the dealer also appeared well satisfied, and if the same
buyer returned to the store after once making a purchase,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
the Arab merchant would recognize and welcome him
with most gracious smiles as if he were one of his warmest
friends.</p>

<p>In these shops there was offered for sale such a varied
and attractive assortment of oriental wares, that by
evening the tourists were laden with packages. Handsome
silk rugs, embroidered silk waists, curiously carved
Algerine weapons, brightly colored leather goods,
articles of hammered brass or copper, silver filagree
work, ornaments of silver and gold, trinkets of ivory,
coral and pearl, fans, photographs, and picture postal
cards purchased during the day, were stored away in
staterooms as souvenirs of Algiers.</p>

<p>At the market stands were fruits and vegetables in
abundance. The dates offered were especially pleasing
in appearance and quality. The bread dealers, we
noticed, sold bread by weight, and added or cut off
chunks and slices in order to give the exact weight
wanted by customers.</p>

<p>The beggars did not trouble us very much by their
importunities, although they were to be seen everywhere
in filth and rags. Street peddlers, however, were persistent
in offering wares and trinkets for sale, and bright
Arab boys, who had learned a few sentences of English
ran after us offering their services as guides.</p>

<p>The coffee shops which we saw while passing through
the streets were as numerous in Algiers as beer saloons
in an American city. As the Mohammedan religion
forbids the use of alcoholic liquors, the Arab followers
of Mahomet appeared to be satisfying their craving
for stimulants by drinking strong black coffee and by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
drinking it often. In the cafés, which are open in
front, allowing all that goes on inside to be visible from
the street, and on the benches outside the shops, we
saw the customers sitting crosslegged slowly imbibing
this favorite beverage from tiny cups. It was plainly
apparent that in this warm climate where there is no
haste, numberless hours are dreamed away on the
benches of these cafés.</p>

</div>

<p>When we left the modern part of the city and ascended
the avenues which lead up the hill toward the older<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
portion we found the streets diminishing in width until
they were only passageways from six to ten feet wide,
bordered by high buildings with blank walls showing no
windows below, but with projecting windows above
which almost meet overhead. In some of these steep,
narrow, crooked streets there are little shops about
the size of a large closet in which the merchant, sitting
crosslegged on bench or cushion, can reach his goods
and wait on his customer without rising or interfering
with the enjoyment of his pipe. As the narrow thoroughfares
are not wide enough for carriages, we had to walk
through them with a guide. We were not favorably
impressed with the odors nor with the sight of the filth
in the streets and were glad when the guide turned from
the gloom and foulness of the ancient Moorish streets
and led us again toward the bright and attractive avenues
of the modern city.</p>

<p>The electric street cars are divided into two compartments;
the first class having thin cushions on the
seats, and the second class having wooden seats without
cushions. The natives save the extra penny of fare
by crowding into the second class, thus giving to the
first class passengers the advantage of always having
enough room. In the second class, however, the
tourists had a more favorable opportunity to study the
people. Opposite us in one of the second class compartments
which we entered sat two veiled women in their
voluminous white bloomers and wrappings. We could
see that one was old by the fact that she leaned upon a
staff, and we decided that the other was young because
she showed some curiosity. Sitting near us was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
little black haired Arab girl with a chunk of dry bread
in her hand, at which she was gnawing greedily. In a
corner seat a meek looking nun in black gown and wide
spreading stiff bonnet was counting the beads of her
rosary as quietly as if alone in her devotions.</p>

<p>"Look," said one, as we were leaving the car, "there
is the 'Thomson and Houston' stamp on the motor."</p>

<p>"Yes," responded another, "American products
appear to be well represented in this French colony."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>On the main business thoroughfare we had noticed
warerooms where 'Singer' sewing machines are sold;
at an agency of the 'Eastman Company' we had restocked
our kodaks with films; and we could not
avoid seeing on a large sign, in letters that could be read
a block away, the words 'American Dentist.' Consequently
when we passed the American Consulate it was
with a feeling of pride that we saluted the National
Emblem which was floating gracefully in the breeze.</p>

<p>In the Rue de Marine we saw an old structure of
large dimensions with a long row of plain white marble
columns in front, which, from its appearance, might be
mistaken for an old warehouse. We were told by a
Moslem guard, who fortunately understood our inquiry
and was able to answer our questions in English, that
the building is the Mosque El Tebir, the Great Mosque,
and that we might enter subject to certain regulations.</p>

<p>"You must remove your shoes," said he, "or wear
slippers over your shoes. You must also pay a small
entrance fee."</p>

<p>In the vestibule, the door-keepers of the Mosque
selected slippers from an assortment of different sizes
which they kept for visitors' use and tied these over our
shoes with tapes. We were then permitted to enter and
wander around the interior over the handsome Persian
rugs which cover the stone floor.</p>

<p>"The Moslems regard their Mosques as very sacred
places consecrated to the worship of Allah, and they
will not permit any profanation of their sanctuary,"
cautioned one of our party, a Presbyterian minister,
seeing that we were inclined to make fun of the slippers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
"The Moslems remove their shoes and enter the place of
worship with reverence, and they expect us to behave
in a respectful manner."</p>

<span class="caption">THE CATHEDRAL ADJOINS THE PALACE OF THE GOVERNOR.</span>
</div>

<p>"The removal of the shoes at the entrance to a place
of worship," continued the minister in explanation,
"is an immemorial Eastern custom based on the words:
'And he said, Draw not nigh hither; put off thy shoes
from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest
is holy ground,' and also on the words: 'And the captain
of the Lord's hosts said unto Joshua, Loose thy shoe
from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest
is holy. And Joshua did so.' We should remember
that the Mohammedan faith is based on the Old Testament,
though supplemented by the instructions of
Mahomet."</p>

<p>In this ancient Mosque, where the worship of Allah
and the study of the Koran has continued for nine
hundred years, we found a few barefoot worshipers,
some kneeling muttering their prayers, while others
squatted on the floor reading the Koran aloud. At
one end of the interior we saw the niche which indicates
the direction in which lies the Holy City of Mecca, and
toward this, as is the custom in all Mohammedan
mosques, the worshipers turn their faces while at
prayer. There were no benches or chairs in the mosque,
as the devotees assumed a crosslegged position on the
thick rugs during the time of their reading, and stood or
knelt while offering prayer.</p>

<p>The Jardin d'Essai, or Botanical Garden, situated in
the suburbs near the sea about two miles from the center
of the city, is reached by an electric street car of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
American make which for a three-cent fare carried us
to the gates. In the garden the large and varied collection
of tropical trees, plants, and vines, so different
from those growing in our own temperate climate, greatly
delighted us. An "Avenue of Palms" half a mile
long was lined with palm trees of many varieties, some
wide-spreading and curiously branching has broad
leaves, and others, high-growing, has tufted tops swaying
in the air fifty or sixty feet above our heads. A
wider avenue of similar length was bordered with
magnolia trees of immense growth which we then saw
only in bud, but it was not difficult to see in imagination
the magnificent picture that would be presented to the
eye, when later on, these millions of buds overhead
would be in full bloom. The "Bamboo Pathway"
led through a dense growth of bamboos whose slender
poles, bending under a slight breeze, kept up a continual
creaking sound. Huge trees, whose wide-spreading
branches were supported by scores of accessory trunks,
so that each tree formed a grove of its own, we recognized
as banyan trees. In one part of the garden, winding
paths led through a tangled tropical growth so dense
and wild that one felt as if in the midst of an African
jungle where a tiger might spring forth or a boa constrictor
drop down on one's head.</p>

<p>On the heights to the east, in the favorite modern
residential district, called Mustapha Superieur, many
large white stone hotels and apartment houses were
situated amid gardens of glossy-leaved orange and lemon
trees. Palms, plane, and pepper trees lined the clean,
wide avenues; green terraces beautified the hillside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
gardens; and villas were almost hidden from sight by the
climbing roses and luxuriant vines with clusters of
purple racemes.</p>

<p>"Many of these villas," said the guide, "are owned by
wealthy English and French families who spend the
winters here. The mild climate and uniform temperature
of our city makes this place a favorite winter resort
not only for invalids, but for those who desire to get
away from the damp fogs and harsh winds of more northern
climates."</p>

<p>"Our city is noted for two views which we think are
unsurpassed," he continued, as the driver reined in his
team on a summit. "One is this which we now look
down upon of city, harbor, sea, and villages near and
distant along the shore. The other, you already have
seen from the deck of the vessel, yet at sunset
you will find that panorama of the city, villages, heights
and mountains even more beautiful."</p>

<p>While we were exploring the city, the officers on the
steamer were engaged in directing the taking on of fresh
supplies of coal, water, and provisions, which had been
purchased at Algiers. During the two days the Moltke
lay in the harbor fifteen hundred tons of coal were
carried in baskets on the shoulders of Arabs from
barges into the hold of the vessel, a slow method of
delivering compared with the rush of the steam scoops
in New York harbor where three thousand tons were
dumped into the bunkers in a few hours' time. Fresh
water also was brought from shore in tank barges and
pumped from these into the tanks on the steamer.
The quantity of fresh water required at this port cost the
steamship company, so the engineer informed us, a
sum equal to four hundred dollars. Also great quantities
of fresh fruits and vegetables were received on
board, one of the most welcome things thus added to our
bountiful bill of fare being the tender green artichoke
which in Algiers grows to perfection.</p>

<p>On Thursday afternoon a reception was held on the
Moltke and our band gave a most enjoyable musical
program for the occasion. Hundreds of well dressed,
courteous French ladies, gentlemen, and children, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
some French officials in uniforms, came on board to visit
the vessel which was thrown wide open for their examination.
Some of the
officers of the naval
vessels also came to
the reception and extended
a cordial invitation
to the tourists
to visit the gunboats.
This invitation was
accepted by some who
were willing to spare
the time for that
purpose.</p>

<p>"Less than one
hundred years ago
Algiers was a country
of pirates," said one
of the officers to a
group of tourists,
"and Algerine corsairs
flying the black
flag infested the Mediterranean
coast. Like
birds of prey they
pounced upon the
merchant vessels of
other nations, confiscating
the cargoes,
seizing seamen and passengers, and burning the ships.
They cast thousands of captives into dungeons and de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>manded
heavy ransoms for their release. They sent
many thousands to the markets to be sold,&mdash;the men to
be degraded to slavery, the women, praying for death,
to be dragged away to harems of their purchasers.
Among the captives held for ransom were many Americans.
But you are familiar with all this ancient
history."</p>

<p>"No, we are not," replied one of the ladies; "I may
have read it but if so, it has slipped from my mind.
Why, we have gone about the city feeling as safe and
secure from harm and insult as we did in our home
cities."</p>

<p>"And you were as safe in Algiers during the day time
as you would be in Paris, London, or New York. I
should advise you, though, to keep off the streets of this
and all Oriental cities after nightfall. We may be
proud to remember that the United States was one of
the first countries to stop paying ransoms and to administer
a salutary reproof. In June of the year 1815
our Commodore Decatur sailed into this harbor and sent
a message to the Dey of Algiers demanding the release
of all Americans then held in captivity, threatening to
bombard the city if the prisoners were not set free.
The Dey after some demur yielded through fear of
bombardment and liberated all the Americans; but sent
a message to the Commodore requesting that a tribute
in the shape of powder be given him in exchange for the
captives. 'If the Dey wants powder, he must take
the balls with it,' Decatur bravely replied. After that
the merchant vessels flying the American flag were not
molested. The great destruction of ships and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
capture of Europeans continued until France, highly
exasperated, determined that it must be stopped, and
the Moors punished. An expedition was sent to Algiers
and the country was conquered in the year 1830, since
then Algiers has been a French colonial possession."</p>

<p>Just as the sun was dropping below the horizon filling
the air with a golden light, the anchor was slowly raised.
A number of the French people who had been visitors
to the Molkte were in a steam launch near by waiting
to see our departure.</p>

<p>"Adieu," "Adieu," "Bon voyage," were the parting
salutations, as the French ladies waved handkerchiefs
and the French men raised their hats.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>As the warships were passed, "Three cheers for the
Red, White, and Blue" were given with a will amid
waving hats, handkerchiefs, and small flags, and our
greeting was answered by the lowering and raising of the
Stars and Stripes on board the warships. Then our
great ship steamed slowly out of the harbor, passing the
the forts which at the extremities of the moles guarded
the entrance, and the lighthouse whose strong, steady
light was just beginning to shine.</p>

<p>As we entered the open sea we looked back with
regret at the scene of beauty behind us. Vessels flying
flags of many nationalities lay at anchor in the
harbor or at the piers. Above the handsome white
stone docks on the sloping hillside rose the clean-looking
white city. On the hill to the right far away in bold
relief stood the Church of our Lady of Africa. To the
left, as far as the eye could reach, along the shore of the
bay beyond the city, were clusters of Moorish houses,
white villages, and green plains, and on the heights
above, white villas and hotels in the midst of green foliage.
In the distance rose a range of high hills, and far beyond
the gray peaks of the Atlas Mountains bounded the
horizon.</p>

<p>No picturing of that scene can show the beauty of the
view there presented to our eyes. But he who has
visited Algiers will never forget the soft harmonizing
colors of blue sky, white and yellow buildings, green
foliage, and gray background.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class="center">THE ISLAND OF MALTA.</p>


<p>Among the tourists were twenty-one Knights
Templar. These Knights took a special interest
in the history of the island of Malta and
the romantic story of the Knights of St. John. For the
benefit of those who desired the information, a lecture on
Malta was delivered by a member of our party who was
familiar with the subject.</p>

<p>"Know something of the history of the island,"
advised the lecturer, "and you will appreciate and enjoy
what you see there more highly than you would without
that knowledge. In the fortifications, the palaces, the
churches, of this island you will find many memorials
of the Knights of Malta, and it may add to your pleasure
to hear something about the famous warrior-monks
before visiting these places."</p>

<p>Many of his hearers, taking the advice, made notes of
the story as related by him.</p>

<p>"About one thousand years ago," he said, "the Order
of the Knights Hospitallers was organized at Jerusalem,
by Italians. Its members took vows of fraternity,
chastity, and poverty. The purpose of the Order was to
erect hospices for the shelter of pilgrims who came to
visit the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem, and hospitals
in which to care for the pilgrims when sick. During
many years of faithful service the work of the Hospitallers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
was supported by contributions from all Christendom;
but when the oppression of the Turks became unendurable,
the Knights took upon themselves vows to fight
in defense of the Christian faith, and the religious
brotherhood became a band of saintly warriors. This
band during the time of the Crusades grew into a great
military order known as the 'Knights of St. John.'
In the battles of the Crusades, the Knights, fighting
against the infidels for the possession of the Holy Land,
became renowned for great personal strength, dauntless
courage, and daring heroism.</p>

<span class="caption">THE HARBOR IS SURROUNDED BY OLD GRAY FORTRESSES.</span>
</div>

<p>"After the failure of the Crusades, the Knights were
expelled from Palestine by the victorious Saracens, and,
twenty years later, were driven from the near-by island
of Cyprus. Fleeing to the island of Rhodes, they there
enjoyed two centuries of power and increasing prosperity,
during which time the banner of the cross remained
victorious over warring Turks, Greeks, and pirates.
Then at the end of this period came the memorable
siege of Rhodes. For six months the steel-clad cavaliers
withstood the assaults of the Ottoman hosts, and their
ponderous battle axes swept down the infidel assailers
by scores. Personal strength, however, could not
endure the continual strain. The besieged, utterly
worn out, were compelled to capitulate and leave
Rhodes; but as a compliment to their valor, they were
permitted by the Sultan to depart in honor, taking
with them all movable property and treasure.</p>

<p>"In the year 1530, the Knights of St. John found a
refuge on the island of Malta. They grew in numbers
and importance, fortified the island, and resumed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
warfare against their hereditary foes. Success at sea
and on land resulted in the capture of richly laden
prizes, multitudes of captives, and booty of enormous
value. The captives became slaves laboring on the
fortifications or straining at the oars. The booty
adorned the churches and enriched the people. But as
power and wealth increased, the desire for spoils took
possession of the hearts of the Knights and the original
vows of humility, kindness, and charity were forgotten.
They became proud and boastful seekers of plunder and
believed themselves to be invincible. Their enemies
called them pirates.</p>

<p>"In 1565 their numbers were greatly reduced during
a noted siege by the Sultan of Turkey. Then fortune
smiled or frowned on them in varying moods for many
years, whose story is filled with romance and interest.
In 1798 the island of Malta, after having been for nearly
three centuries in the possession of the Knights of St.
John, was captured by an invading French force, and
two years later it became, by conquest, an English
possession.</p>

<p>"The fortifications have since then been strengthened
and equipped with modern armaments, so that the island
is now considered an impregnable stronghold. Here,
as at Gibraltar, an army is stationed in the barracks,
and great quantities of provisions are kept in store to
supply the garrison in case of siege. The harbor of
Valetta is deep and safe, and the narrow entrance is
commanded by three strong fortresses. Here is the
headquarters of the Mediterranean fleet of the British
navy. Here, also, are great repair docks, a coaling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
station where huge stocks of coal are kept on hand, and
warehouses filled with naval supplies.</p>

<p>"The island is densely populated, the number of people
to the square mile being four times greater than in
England. The city of Valetta, the capital of Malta,
named after the Grand Master, Jean de La Vallette, by
whom it was founded in the sixteenth century, stands
high above the water on a commanding promontory."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>"In this condensed account," said the lecturer in
conclusion, "I have tried to give you a few of the main
facts relating to the Knights and the island. Those
of you who are interested in the romantic history may
read it more fully when you have leisure after your
return home."</p>

<p>The Moltke cast anchor in the harbor of Valetta about
six o'clock on the morning of the twenty-first of February.
After we had partaken of an early breakfast,
Maltese boatmen in scarlet caps and sashes, who stood
up while handling their oars, rowed us to the shore.
Their brightly painted boats had peculiar carved wooden
posts erected at prow and stern and white awnings
overhead. Walking up a sloping, zigzag pathway,
constructed in a passage cut down through the high
cliffs, we ascended from the busy docks to the heights
above. At the summit a Maltese gentleman kindly
directed us on our way to the Queen's Garden located
directly above the landing place.</p>

<p>From the parapets of this place a magnificent and
interesting view of the harbor was obtained. Not far
away, but hundreds of feet below us, the Moltke lay,
encircled by the white awning-covered boats. Eight
large battleships and a dozen cruisers and gunboats,
all painted black, were lying peacefully at anchor.
Steamships and sailing vessels at the docks were discharging
cargoes, or were lying in the bay awaiting
their turn to unload. Steam launches were busily
flying from one point to another, and little ferry boats
were constantly crossing and re-crossing the bay. The
harbor was surrounded by high cliffs and old gray forti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>fications.
At the entrance to the bay stood a tall
lighthouse and a frowning fortress, the one for guidance,
the other for protection. Through the entrance a ship
with spread sails was entering, and beyond, the sunlight
shone on the beautiful blue waters of the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>The streets of Valetta were full of life that day. In
reply to inquiries we were informed that on the following
day, the Sunday preceding Lent, a festa, or carnival,
lasting three days, would begin. During the festa,
business would be suspended, and the people, disguised
in masks and fanciful costumes, would engage in most
ludicrous and extraordinary antics and play all manner
of practical jokes on one another, showering the passers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>-by
gently with confetti and flowers, or pelting them
stingingly with dried peas and beans. Many children,
impatient for the morrow to come, were already parading
the streets arrayed in their costumes.</p>

<p>Attractive stores line the "Strada Reale," the main
shopping street. In these stores laces, gold and silver
filagree work, jewelry, and embroidered muslins were
the principal wares sought by the tourists. The ladies
of our party were particularly anxious to secure pieces
of Maltese lace, a special hand-made product noted for
the excellence of its quality, the making of which gives
employment to thousands of the inhabitants. In trading
with the Maltese merchants, we soon found that the
prices asked by the dealers were about twice the amount
the customer was expected to pay, and that bargaining
was as necessary in Malta as in Algiers.</p>

<p>Almost all the costumes we saw on the streets were of
the English style, but the varied uniforms of soldiers and
the distinctive garments of Greeks, Turks, Spaniards,
and Arabs added color and interest to the scene. The
Maltese women wear immense bonnets, called faldettas.
These peculiar bonnets have long skirts which reach
to the waist and are totally black without color or
ornament. As the majority of the inhabitants are
Roman Catholics, we saw many priests and monks who
wore black robes and very broad-brimmed black hats
turned up at the sides.</p>

<p>The Maltese are lovers of flowers, which are raised in
profusion. At the corners of the principal streets were
small fanciful buildings, a few feet in diameter, in which
dark eyed brunettes offered flowers and bonbons for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
sale. The people also love music. In the Opera House,
an elaborate structure, which, we were told, cost a
quarter of a million dollars, Grand Opera is given three
times a week for six months in the year.</p>

<p>We visited the old church of St. John, which was built
three centuries ago and lavishly adorned out of the
proceeds of plunder that had been taken from infidels
and pirates. The tower above the church contains a
chime of ten bells, and the clock on the tower has a
triple face, one face showing the hour of the day, one
showing the day of the week, and the third, the day of
the month. The heavy doors were open, but a curtain
of matting hung over the entrance. A ragged, barefoot
boy ran before us, and, drawing aside the matting that
we might enter, extended his hand for a penny. We
walked over the beautiful inlaid mosaic marble floor,
and beheld handsomely painted ceilings with life-size
figures overhead, and richly decorated walls and pillars
around us. A priest with pride pointed out the famous
paintings on the walls, the bronze and the marble
statues around the sides, and, in the various chapels,
the three huge iron keys which opened the gates of
Jerusalem, Acre, and Rhodes, and the gates of solid
silver in front of the richly decorated altar. As we
stood before the silver gates our guide told us his little
story:</p>

<p>"When the French captured Malta in 1798 they
carried away as booty the most valuable possessions of
the church in the form of precious jewels, silver statues,
golden vessels, valuable vestments, and works of art.
The Emperor Napoleon with his own hand took a most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
valuable diamond from the finger of the jeweled glove
which covered the sacred relic, the hand of St. John, and
placed it on his own finger. The Emperor also took
the diamond mounted sword, which had been carried
by Valette, and buckled it to his side. These silver
gates, too, would have been carried away but for the
forethought of a priest who painted them black and so
concealed their value."</p>

<p>In the nave of this church we tramped over hundreds
of marble slabs which have been placed among the
mosaics in the floor as memorials of the knights and
nobles who are buried underneath. These flat tombstones
are adorned with representations of coats-of-arms,
musical instruments, angels, crowns, palms,
skeletons, and other odd devices. But in the crypt
underneath, whither we were next conducted, majestic
monuments of elaborate design mark the resting
places of the most noted Grand Masters of the Order,
the tomb of Grand Master Cottoner being one of the
most imposing. In the sacristy we gazed at, but were
not permitted to touch, the beautifully illuminated
missals, the finely woven pieces of ancient embroidery,
and the splendid robes of former Grand Masters.</p>

<p>"The tapestry of the Lord's Supper and many other
wonderful tapestries are locked in that chamber,"
said the priest, pointing to a closed door, "and are only
exhibited in June each year."</p>

<p>At one of the altars in a side chapel worshipers knelt
before a piece of the true cross; but the relics regarded
as most precious in the custody of the Church of St.
John, a thorn from the Savior's crown, portions of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
bones of three apostles, one of the stones cast at St.
Stephen, the right foot of Lazarus, and a fragment of
the cradle of the infant Jesus, are guarded with great
care and rarely exposed to the gaze of curious eyes.</p>

<p>In the Governor's Palace the tourists spent a short
time. The walls of the Council Chamber are hung
with rare tapestry which has retained its color and
beauty for nearly three centuries. The dining room
and corridors are decorated with paintings of grim-faced
Grand Masters of the past; and the gorgeous
ball room contains a throne on which these same rulers
sat in state surrounded by pomp and splendor. In the
great hall of the Armory are rows of figures clad in the
antique armor worn by the Knights, together with steel
gloves, helmets, and coats of mail, inlaid with gold and
silver; and around this hall are arranged the crossbows,
arquebuses, spears, pikes, swords, battle axes, and old
battle flags. There with the treasures are the old
silver trumpet that sounded the retreat from Rhodes,
and the faded parchment manuscript, or Papal edict,
which sanctioned the gift of the island by Charles V.
of Germany to the Knights; and among the trophies
are the jeweled coat of mail and weapons of a famous
Algerine corsair, a cannon curiously constructed of a
copper tube wound with tarred rope, and many torn and
blood-stained, crescent-mounted standards which in
the hand-to-hand conflicts had been captured from the
Turks.</p>

<p>"What soldier of the present day could march or even
ride any distance so encumbered with steel?" remarked
one of the tourists as we stood before an emblazoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
suit of mail that had been worn by one of the Grand
Masters of the Knights. "To handle these heavy
battle axes or long spears for stroke after stroke or
thrust after thrust during the long hours the battle
raged must have required muscles of steel and wonderful
powers of endurance."</p>

<p>"These breastplates and helmets and shields, which
were worn by the Knights to protect them from the
arrows and spears of their enemies," said one of the
ladies, as she looked at the old armor, "enable me to
understand better what St. Paul meant when he wrote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
to the Ephesians: 'Put on the whole armor of God that
you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil,'
and 'all the fiery darts of the wicked.' The old monk-soldiers
must have interpreted that command literally
when they went out to fight the infidels."</p>

<p>After completing our sight-seeing in the city of
Valetta, a little train of cars on a narrow-gauge railroad
carried us a distance of six miles to the older city of
Citta Vecchia. The land along the way as far as we
could see was divided into small plots ranging from
about half an acre to two acres in size. Each plot
was surrounded by stone walls from six to ten feet in
height, many of which were broken and dilapidated.
We were told that, although the climate of the island is
quite mild, violent winds frequently blow over it, and
these walls were erected to protect the fig, orange,
lemon, and other fruit trees from destruction. Protected
from the high winds, these trees yield abundantly;
and, in the fertile soil of these plots, two or three crops
of vegetables are raised each year. Much of the land
was rocky and uncultivated. Very few trees were seen
and those were dwarfed. One species of evergreen
tree, called the Carob, grew only ten feet in height, but
spread to three times that in breadth. In some neglected
spots the prickly pear grew in rank masses. The
houses along the way, built of yellow or gray stone, had
a weather-beaten look, and the yards around them were
enclosed with high walls. The small square windows
in the houses and the flat stone roofs with enclosing
parapets reminded us of pictures of the houses in Bible
stories.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>In Citta Vecchia the two principal attractions were the
Cathedral of St. Paul and the Grotto of St. Paul. The
Cathedral is said to be built on the site of the house of
Publius, the governor of the island, who entertained
and lodged St. Paul for three days after he was ship-wrecked
on this island, which in the Bible is called
Melita. The Grotto is said to have been occupied by
St. Paul during his three months' stay on the island.
About four miles from the Cathedral is the bay of St.
Paul, where the apostle was wrecked while on his way
to Rome. There is the little creek in which the sailors
tried to guide the storm-tossed vessel and the shore to
which they escaped "on boards and on broken pieces
of the ship."</p>

<p>In Citta Vecchia we were shown the mosaic pavement
and the decorated frieze of an old Roman house supposed
to be over two thousand years old, which had been
uncovered at a considerable distance below the surface
while an excavation was being made. Notwithstanding
their age the old mosaic pavement and frieze were in
good condition.</p>

<p>An interesting day of sight-seeing closed with a drive
in Valetta through the humbler part of the city and
down a long inclined street which led to the docks.
At nightfall as our steamship moved eastward the
lights of Malta's stronghold gradually faded from our
sight, but the gleam of its lighthouse followed us for
many a mile.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="center">ATHENS AND THE ACROPOLIS.</p>


<p>The sun was just appearing in the east as we approached
the seaport of the Grecian capital.</p>

<p>Through the mists of the dawning day we could
make out dimly, ahead of us, only bleak bare hills. As
the Moltke steamed through the straits we saw a lighthouse
and a few buildings on the shore and over the low
hill on our right the tops of masts; but when the vessel
had entered through a narrow passage between the moles
extending from either side, and had anchored in the
centre of the well protected and commodious harbor of
Piræus, we gazed on a scene of animation and activity.
The bay was filled with shipping and the shore lined
with warehouses where the stevedores were already
busily engaged in lading or discharging cargoes. On
each side of the Moltke, little more than a stone's throw
away, lay gray battleships, cruisers, torpedo boats,
destroyers, and other naval craft.</p>

<p>"What war vessels are those?" was the question
asked eagerly by many passengers.</p>

<p>"The white flag with the blue St. Andrew's cross
floating over that warship is the Russian national
emblem," patiently replied one of the officers of our
steamer, "and so I conclude that these vessels compose
the Russian Mediterranean squadron."</p>

<p>A band on the flagship began to play and the Russian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
sailors in clean white suits were seen forming in lines
on the decks of the vessels, evidently for inspection or
morning roll-call. On the rigging above the sailors'
heads, swaying in the breeze, were hundreds of white
suits, washed and hung out to dry.</p>

<span class="caption">HUNDREDS OF WHITE SUITS HUNG OUT TO DRY.</span>

<p>Soon fifty or more large row boats were plying around
our steamer in readiness to convey us to the railroad
station at the upper end of the harbor about a mile away.
As we approached the shore in these boats we saw on the
wharf at Piræus a motley crowd of dirty-handed, bare-footed,
ill-clothed men and boys. It seemed as if all
the idle and vagabond population of the city had assembled
to lounge lazily in the sun, hoping, perhaps, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
obtain some small coins from the tourists during the
transfer from boat to cars. If this was their hope they
were disappointed. All arrangements for the welfare
of the Moltke tourists had been carefully made in advance,
and, as there was no baggage to be carried, the
services of the dirty-handed men were not required.</p>

<p>"Are these vagabonds and tramps the descendants
of the noble Greeks whom we have honored all our
lives?" sadly remarked a minister in our boat. "Can
these be the offspring of the great orators who electrified
their hearers, or of the famous architects and artists
whose names are immortal? Are these swarthy-faced,
plain-featured idlers the representatives of the Greek
beauty of form and feature?"</p>

<p>In preparation for a visit to these historic shores we
had filled our minds with tales of heroism and visions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
of the beautiful; now the sight of this bare-footed
throng, so different from the pictures we had formed in
our minds, was a severe shock to our imagination.</p>

<p>"These vagabonds do not represent the Greek race,"
responded another who had traveled in that country
before; "they are merely the dregs of the people, a
class that may be found in any large city and especially
in the seaports."</p>

<p>The distance from Piræus to the city of Athens is but
five miles. From the windows of the little cars we could
see that the valley through which we passed was a succession
of well cultivated fields, vineyards, and gardens.
A white road, almost parallel to the railroad, traversed
the valley. Gray-green trees in the distance indicated a
district of olive orchards.</p>

<p>At a station on the outskirts of the city we left the
train and followed an old guide to visit the Theseum, or
Temple of Theseus, a large edifice built in simple Doric
style. The plain columns and unadorned pediments
express strength and simplicity rather than beauty.
Notwithstanding the fact that twenty-four centuries
have passed since its erection, this temple is noted as
being the best preserved of all the ancient buildings of
Greece. A short time, however, sufficed for a view of
the plain exterior and an entrance into the gloomy
interior.</p>

<p>Then proceeding along a fine modern road, built over
the ruins of the ancient city, traces of which were seen
in adjacent excavations, we passed, on our right, an
open plateau on the rocks where an audience of eight
or ten thousand might assemble. This was the Pynx<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
of ancient times, a gathering place of the people. A
flight of steps hewn in the stone at one side of this
plateau leads up to a platform cut in the rock. From
this rock, named the Platform of Demosthenes, great
orators addressed the multitude, stirring their countrymen
to deeds of valor. Beyond the Pynx, a cave with
gates of rusty grated iron was pointed out as the prison
in which the noble Socrates was incarcerated before
being condemned to drink the fatal hemlock.</p>

<span class="caption">ONCE THE MAGNIFICENT MARBLE STAIRCASE.</span>
</div>

<p>Farther up the slope the guide pointed to a small
rock elevation on our left and said: "That is the
Areopagus, or Mars Hill, from which the Apostle Paul
made his appeal to the idolatrous Athenians. He probably
ascended those sixteen steps that you see hewn in
the rock. Where we are standing now, the people
stood to listen. From that elevation Paul could view<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
the avenues leading to the Acropolis, avenues adorned
with statues in honor of gods and goddesses and famous
heroes."</p>

title="IN HONOR OF NIKE, THE GODDESS OF VICTORY." />
<span class="caption">IN HONOR OF NIKE, THE GODDESS OF VICTORY.</span>
</div>

<p>As we stood there, we could almost hear Paul's words:</p>

<p>"Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are
too superstitious. For as I passed by, and beheld the
gods that ye worship, I found an altar with this inscription,
'To the Unknown God.'&mdash;God dwelleth not in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
temples made with hands.&mdash;We ought not to think
that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone,
graven by art and man's device." The altar to the
unknown god to which Paul referred may have been
one of the many altars within sight of the elevation on
which he stood.</p>

<p>After we left Mars Hill a few minutes' walk brought
us to the foot of a long flight of ruined steps, at the top
of which stood broken marble columns. Before us was
the Acropolis, the highest point of the city, a rocky
eminence with inaccessible cliffs on three sides. The
only approach to its summit, which is about two hundred
feet above the level of the modern city, is on the southwest
side, being reached by the avenues we had followed
up the gradual slope past Mars Hill.</p>

<p>"On this height," said the guide, "the Athenians,
during the reign of Pericles in the golden age of Greece,
erected a temple to their patron deity, Minerva, the
goddess of wisdom. And to this goddess, named also
Athena, who, as they asserted, sprang from the brain
of Jupiter a mature woman in complete armor, they
looked for protection. For her they offered their
choicest gifts, yet they did not neglect the multitude of
other gods whom they feared to offend."</p>

<p>The old guide was well informed, but his English
was rather difficult to understand. He was interrupted
a number of times until one of the tourists, a
college professor, undertook the task of assisting him
in the story.</p>

<p>"These dilapidated stone steps," said the professor,
"formed once the magnificent marble staircase that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
led to the gateway of the Acropolis. The staircase was
seventy feet in width; in the centre was a sloping
carriageway up which chariots could be driven. It was
built by Pericles four hundred years before the Christian
era. Statues of wonderful beauty, by famous sculptors,
were arranged along the steps. At times of great
rejoicing, as after a victory, triumphal processions
ascended these flights to present offerings to the gods,
or to deposit in the treasury of the temple the spoils
taken from their enemies and to offer sacrifices and
worship to their protecting goddess. The Propylæa,
or grand entrance hall and gateway to the Acropolis,
stood at the head of the stairway; these broken columns
are all that remain of one of the most imposing structures
of that golden age."</p>

<p>"Keep close to the professor and never mind the
guide," urged one of our companions. We followed
her suggestion.</p>

<p>"This small building on our right with four graceful
Ionic columns in front," continued the professor, "is
the Temple of the Wingless Victory, so called because
it was erected by the Athenians in honor of Nike, the
goddess of Victory. The statue of Nike which they
placed within the temple, bore in her hand the palm of
victory and upheld the wreath of laurel, but lacked
the customary wings. The Athenians hoped that
without wings victory might never depart from the
shores of Greece."</p>

<p>"The building to our left," said the professor as we
moved on, "was named the Erechtheum after the
Attic hero Erechtheus, and once contained a seated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
figure of the goddess Athena. These six gigantic statues
of women upholding the cornice of the porch are the
Caryatides and deserve a careful examination; for,
although carefully prepared casts of the Caryatides
may be seen in some of the large museums, no cast can
be a perfect representation of the original. One of
these figures, as you may easily see, is only a copy, the
original having been carried away to England by Lord
Elgin and given to the British Museum. The marble
columns on the other side of the Erechtheum are considered
the best examples in existence of the Ionic
style of architecture."</p>

<span class="caption">ACROSS THE SUMMIT OF THE ACROPOLIS, TRAMPLING OVER FRAGMENTS OF DECORATIONS.</span>
</div>

<p>Near the Erechtheum we passed the foundation on
which had stood a colossal bronze figure of Athena,
sixty feet in height, holding in her hand a spear tipped
with gold, the point of which could be seen by the
ancient mariners far out at sea. Making our way
across the summit of the Acropolis around pieces of
broken columns, trampling over fragments of decorations,
and passing foundations of missing statues, we
stood in front of the Parthenon, the temple which had
been erected to the patron deity of the Athenians. We
thought that the professor might weary of answering
questions, but he seemed glad to voice the thoughts that
were arising in his mind.</p>

<p>"In the harmonious proportions of this stately
edifice," he said, "the peerless genius of the architect
Ictinus, who designed the structure, is revealed, and in
the delicate finish of the smallest details of the sculptured
work, the wonderful skill of the artists who
carried out the master's design is shown. We hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
know which to admire more, the matchless genius of
the designer, or the marvelous skill of the artists. Our
poet Emerson truly says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Earth proudly wears the Parthenon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the best gem upon her throne."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>During a pause for critical examination of the front
of the temple, the amateur photographers of the party
placed their cameras in position.</p>

<p>"Place a group of people in the foreground," suggested
the professor. "You see that the marble steps are nearly
two feet in height, and without some object for comparison,
these steps in a picture will appear to be only
of ordinary size, thus an adequate idea of the size of the
temple will not be given. When you see any picture of
the Parthenon notice the truth of my suggestion.</p>

<p>"There were, as you see at this end now," continued
our instructor, "eight white marble columns at each end
and seventeen columns along each side. The columns
on the sides are mostly broken now or altogether gone,
and the color has changed from white to this soft golden
yellow tint. The carved marble frieze, which, over five
hundred feet in length, extended around the building,
was the work of Phidias and has never been surpassed
in beauty by any sculpture of the kind in the world.
And these fluted columns are, in grace and proportion,
the noblest examples of the Doric style of architecture."</p>

<p>"But, in the interior," said the professor, becoming
more enthusiastic, "surrounded by statues and works of
art in marble, bronze, ebony, ivory, and gold, stood the
crowning glory of the Parthenon, the famous colossal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
statue of the goddess Athena Parthenos, Athena the
Virgin, forty feet in height, made of ivory and gold under
the direction of Phidias. The Caryatides as we looked
at them awhile ago appeared gigantic in size, but they
are only eight feet in height. The height of the statue
of Athena was equal to five Caryatides one above the
other. Let me read you the description of the statue
by an old Greek historian, Pausanias."</p>

<p>The professor, drawing a note book from his pocket,
read as follows: "The image itself is made of ivory and
gold. Its helmet is surmounted in the middle by the
figure of a sphinx, and on either side of the helmet are
griffins wrought in relief. The image of Athena stands
upright, clad in a garment that reaches to her feet; on
her breast is the head of Medusa wrought in ivory. She
holds a Victory about four cubits high in one hand, and
in the other hand a spear. At her feet lies a shield, and
near the spear is a serpent."</p>

<p>"The Victory referred to by Pausanias," said the
professor, replacing his note book, "was an image of the
goddess of Victory half the height of the Caryatides,
which we refer to for comparison. The size of the
statue held in Athena's hand helps us to realize the
height of the colossal figure."</p>

<p>"The Parthenon contained also a treasury in which
the Athenians deposited the immense treasures and
spoils taken from their enemies. In the course of centuries,
however, the growing wealth and power of
Athens incurred the jealousy and wrath of other nations.
The city was conquered and ravaged many times. The
Persians ingloriously failed in their attempt, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
Romans, victorious under Nero, despoiled this temple
and carried away hundreds of bronze statues and works
of art to grace the Emperor's triumphal entry into
Rome. Other Roman conquerors, following Nero's
example, exhibited to the applauding multitudes in the
streets of Rome long trains of spoils, consisting of the
rarest paintings, ornaments, and bronzes torn from the
Parthenon. Goths, Normans, Franks, Venetians, and
Vandals successively plundered the city, stripping away
the decorations of gold and silver from columns and
walls, and breaking from their foundations the statues
that adorned the plateau of the Acropolis. The Turks
carried off shiploads of marble and bronzes to Constantinople.
England also enriched the British Museum
with many choice marbles from the Acropolis&mdash;to
preserve them, Lord Elgin explained."</p>

<p>The professor paused for a moment and his hearers
made use of the time to express some very decided
opinions with reference to Lord Elgin.</p>

<p>"But the culminating disaster to the Parthenon
occurred in the year 1687," continued the professor,
resuming his story with as much sadness in his voice as
if the disaster had been a personal loss. "Greece was
then under the rule of the Sultan, and the Parthenon
was used by his army as a powder magazine. The
Venetians at war with the Turks, besieging Athens,
bombarded the city. A shell descended into the Parthenon,
and in a moment's time the most magnificent
architectural structure of ancient times, the pride of
centuries, lay shattered in the ruins we see before us."</p>

<p>"The Parthenon in twenty-four centuries has seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
many religious changes. Built first as a temple of
idolatry, it became under the Romans a Roman Catholic
Cathedral, under the Greeks again a Greek Christian
Church, and then under the Sultan's rule a Mohammedan
Mosque."</p>

<p>"Why," said one of the tourists, "we have sailed half
way around the world to see these ruins, and yet some
of us have so neglected history and mythology that, we
are ashamed to say, our knowledge of the history of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
Greece and the stories of its heroes is extremely limited.

<p>After walking through the small museum on the
Acropolis where a number of interesting relics are on
exhibition, we lingered awhile on a little platform at the
northeast corner of the Acropolis from which an excellent
view of the city may be obtained. As seen from this
view-point the predominating color of the city is yellow.
The buildings erected of stone, and plastered or frescoed,
are white, or yellow, or light pink, or combinations of
yellow and white, and the roofs appear to be covered
with yellow tiles. Below us to the right we saw the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
ruined columns of the Temple of Jupiter, and the white
palace and the royal gardens of the king. Across the
valley beyond the city we could see the prominent steep
rock named Lycabettus with the chapel of St. George
on the summit, and ten miles away we could make out
dimly Mt. Pentelicus, from which all the white marble
for the temples was quarried, and Mt. Hymettus, in a
region noted for the excellent quality of its honey.</p>

<p>Descending from the heights of the Acropolis we
entered the ruins of the Odeon of Herodus Atticus which
lay at the base of the Acropolis. This theatre had a
stone floor, a stone stage, and tiers of stone seats capable
of seating an audience of six thousand, and was covered
with a cedar roof. Now the roof is completely gone
and the seats are in partial ruin. Beyond this smaller
theatre are the ruins of a larger one called the Theatre of
Bacchus. Here the masterpieces of Eschylus, Sophocles,
Euripides, and Aristophanes, in the golden days
of Grecian glory, gave delight to great audiences. This
theatre, accommodating thirty thousand spectators,
contained a semi-circle of marble seats built up against
the cliff of the Acropolis, and was open to the sky. The
large stage was built of marble and the front of it was
carved with grotesque figures. The lower tiers of seats
nearest the stage were marble chairs reserved for priests
and other dignitaries. The names of the men who occupied
the chairs were carved in the marble, and some
of these names are yet visible. While resting for a
short time in these official chairs, we tried to imagine
that we were viewing on the marble stage the performance
of an old Greek tragedy by actors in the graceful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
flowing robes of those ancient times. A few minutes
later we were grouped at the side of the columns which
are all that remain of the glory of the Temple of Jupiter.</p>

<span class="caption">WE DROVE AROUND THE ROYAL GARDENS.</span>

<p>The professor, responding to our request for information,
said: "The Olympieum was the Temple erected
in honor of Zeus, the supreme deity of the Greeks. As
the Roman name for the supreme deity was Jupiter or
Jove, the temple was called the Temple of Zeus by the
Greeks, and the Temple of Jupiter by the Romans. The
Athenians began the construction of the edifice two
centuries before the birth of Christ, but the work was
interrupted by wars and lack of funds and remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
unfinished for three hundred years. Then the Roman
Emperor Hadrian, having conquered Greece, completed
the work and claimed for himself all the honor and
glory for the erection of the temple. The Temple of
Zeus, next to that erected to Diana by the Ephesians,
was the largest of the temples of antiquity. It was
built in the Corinthian style of architecture and had a
triple row of eight columns each at the ends, and a
double row of twenty columns each at the sides. Now
you see only these fifteen huge columns remaining. In
the interior of the temple was a colossal statue of Jupiter
overlaid with ivory and gold. Beside the statue of the
god stood a companion figure of equal size representing
the Emperor Hadrian. The grounds around the temple
were filled by Hadrian with hundreds of statues, many
of which represented himself."</p>

<p>Carriages which had been ordered by the managers of
the excursion awaited here to take us rapidly to other
points of interest. As we crossed a bridge over a little
stream on our way to the Stadium, the guide said: "This
river appears small, perhaps, in your eyes, but it is great
in the history and legends of Greece. It is the river
Ilissus."</p>

<p>"The Stadium," said the professor as we entered the
structure, "is the immense athletic field of Athens. It
was constructed about the year 350 B.C. Five hundred
years later the sixty tiers of seats capable of seating
fifty thousand spectators were covered with white
marble. Centuries afterwards in evil times athletic
sports were neglected, the place fell into disuse, and the
marble was converted into lime. In modern times the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
Stadium has been restored, perhaps not so large as before,
and again the tiers of seats have been covered with
white marble. In international athletic contests held
in the restored Stadium, Americans have competed
successfully for the laurel crown."</p>

<span class="caption">THE TIERS OF SEATS HAVE BEEN COVERED WITH WHITE MARBLE.</span>

<p>Leaving the Stadium, we drove around the Royal
Gardens through streets shaded by graceful pepper trees,
caught glimpses of palms, orange, and ornamental trees
within the gardens, and stopped a few minutes in front
of the extensive white marble palace of the king. As
we passed through the residential portion of the city we
were impressed with the cleanliness of the well swept
streets and with the purity of the soft creamy yellow
and pink colorings of the buildings. Fortunately we
saw no great manufacturing establishments belching
forth volumes of blackening smoke to soil these delicate
shades.</p>

<p>We halted before the University, a majestic building
occupying a block on a wide boulevard, and before the
Academy of Science, another large white marble edifice
adjoining the University, a building much more elaborate
than its neighbor, with Ionic porticoes, a facade
enlivened by bright coloring and gilding, and pediments
adorned with statues.</p>

<p>"What odd-looking costumes those men wear. They
look like ballet girls arrayed for the stage," said one of
the ladies in our carriage, pointing to a group on the sidewalk.
The men wore tights, low shoes with pompons
on the toes, black garters with tassels, blue jackets
ornamented with many brass buttons, red skull caps
with large black tassels, and very full skirts. The guide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
said that these men were soldiers of the king's guard and
though their uniforms might appear peculiar to our
eyes they did not seem more strange than the tartans of
Scotch Highlanders were to the Greeks. The king's
guard, he told us, is composed of men from the mountain
regions of Greece, who dress in the ancient military
costume of that section. The uniforms of the regular
Greek soldiers are very similar to those worn by the
soldiers of our own country. The officers we met were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
handsome men and especially well uniformed. The
well-to-do and middle class Athenian people whom we
saw on the streets were dressed in modern English style.</p>

<p>The National Archæological Museum has a valuable
collection of antiquities that would require much time
for examination. Perhaps the most interesting to us
were the old tombs from Mycenæ with their resurrected
contents of skeletons, gold masques, ornaments, and
weapons; the reduced copy of the gold and ivory
statue of Athena Parthenos; the marble figure of a man
in stooping position lately found in the sea; the statue of
the god Hermes; and the large and beautiful vases recovered
from the excavations. On the vases scenes of
ancient Greek life or legend were represented.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was a pastoral scene of love-making carved on a
Grecian vase that inspired the poet Keats to write his
noted poem, 'Ode on a Grecian Urn,'" said one of our
friends. "Let me tell you my favorite stanza," and,
with an eloquence that brought out their meaning,
she repeated the beautiful lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not to the sensual ear, but, more endear'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair youth, beneath the trees, thou canst not leave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy song, nor ever can those trees be bare;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bold lover, never, never canst thou kiss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though winning near the goal&mdash;yet, do not grieve;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She cannot fade, though thou hast not thy bliss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forever wilt thou love, and she be fair!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>On both days while in Athens we lunched at one of the
hotels facing Constitution Square and ate of the delicious
honey from Mt. Hymettus, returning to the Moltke in
the harbor in time to have a late dinner and to spend
the night. In the public park in front of the hotel the
trees were laden with oranges. Beyond the park
through the green foliage could be seen the white palace
of the king.</p>

<p>While rambling through the streets we saw a funeral
procession. First came many banners and symbols of
the Greek Church, carried by church officials; then followed
the casket borne by men, the casket open and the
pale face of the dead exposed to the gaze of the onlookers;
a man came next carrying the lid of the coffin
filled with flowers; then priests in black robes, men and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
women in black, and girls in white holding wreaths and
flowers. The people along the way removed their hats
and crossed themselves, muttering prayers as the procession
passed by.</p>

<p>The modern religion of Greece is that of the Greek
church, a religion of many ceremonies. The priests,
long-haired, heavy-bearded men, wear long flowing
black robes and black hats resembling our silk dress
hats turned upside down with the brim at the top.
They, the guide informed us, are men of influence; their
hands are kissed by their people; their advice is sought,
and their opinions received with deference by the members
of their church.</p>

<p>The stores for the sale of candles to be burned on
ceremonial occasions made an interesting display.
There were candles of all sizes, ranging from six feet
in height, beautifully decorated, which only the wealthy
could afford, down to the small unadorned dip that the
smallest coin might purchase.</p>

<p>"These candles," said the guide while we were pricing
some of the decorated ones, "are used for the rejoicings
at baptisms, at the festivities on wedding occasions,
and for lightening the gloom around the caskets of the
dead. They are given as penance to the church, or as
votive offerings to brighten the altars of the Virgin or
patron saints."</p>

<p>Eikons, the sacred memorials which the Greek Christians
hang in their homes, representing the Virgin Mary
holding the infant Christ in her arms, were also for sale
in great numbers. Some of these were merely painted
boards or silvered or gilded metal; others were of ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>pensive
material, incrusted with jewels. In all the
Eikons, either cheap or dear, the painted faces and heads
of the Virgin and child were visible through openings in
the metal or board.</p>

<p>"At Easter time,"
said one of the dealers
in ecclesiastical wares,
"we sell thousands of
candles for the great
midnight celebration
of the lighting of the
candles. Just as the
Easter day is ushered
in, the Patriarch from
his platform makes
the announcement,
'Christ is risen.' The
people repeat it over
and over, the candles
are lighted, then raised
and lowered three
times in honor of the
Trinity, and we return
to our homes to break
the three days' fast
by a feast of rejoicing."</p>

<p>When returning
from the wharf to the steamer in the evening some of
the tourists were conveyed in a tug and others in row
boats. The oarsmen to save the labor of rowing cast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
their lines to the tug and the dancing of the little boats
on the waves as they were drawn swiftly down the
bay in the wake of the larger craft caused some anxiety
on the part of the more timid of the occupants.</p>

<p>On the evening of Tuesday, the twenty-fourth of
February, just as the silver-toned bells on the Russian
warships were telling the hour of five, the anchor of the
Moltke was drawn up and the vessel almost imperceptibly
moved around and headed for the narrow outlet
between the breakwaters. As we slowly steamed away
from the Russian vessels, our band played the Russian
national hymn and the Russian flag was elevated to the
top of the Moltke's mast in a farewell salutation. Immediately
the crowds of Russian sailors on the warships
removed their hats and remained bareheaded until the
music ceased. Then, in response, the Russian band
played our national hymn, and as we sailed away, the
strains of the music became fainter and fainter until they
died away in the distance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>Looking backward after leaving the harbor we saw
clearly defined, in the golden evening light, the towering
Acropolis and the Parthenon crowning its summit, and,
as we sailed away from the city which was once the
centre of culture, refinement, and wealth, we tried to recall
the stories of her glorious past. The figures of
legend, myth, and history,&mdash;mighty warriors, celebrated
heroes, eloquent orators, illustrious painters, renowned
architects, great historians, immortal poets, and wonderful
deities; Spartan mothers, Thermopylæ defenders,
and Persian invaders; beautiful Helen, muscular Hercules,
crusty Diogenes, deformed Æsop, silver-tongued
Demosthenes, fleet-footed Mercury, drunken Silenus,
stately Juno, and lovely Venus,&mdash;a confused procession
of mortals and immortals rushed across the brain.</p>

<p>"Look," said the professor with note book in hand
interrupting our dreams of the past, "that strait to the
left behind us is the entrance to the bay of Salamis where
the Persian fleet of one thousand sail encountered the
smaller fleet of only three hundred Grecian vessels in the
year 480 B.C. The rocky brow of the hill on the farther
side of the strait is the place where the haughty Xerxes
sat in his silver-footed chair to gloat over the expected
annihilation of Greek power. I want to read to you,
before we go to our evening meal, the vivid description
of the conflict from the tragedy of 'The Persians.' It
was written by the poet Eschylus, who himself was one
of the heroes in the fight.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>"</p>

<p>On Wednesday morning, February twenty-fifth,
the ladies donned winter wraps and the gentlemen
heavy overcoats for their morning promenades
on deck. All night the Moltke had steamed
northward and the region of palms and orange trees
had been left behind. By referring to the large
atlas of the world in the library, we found that we
were in the same latitude as that of New York City.</p>

<p>As we approached the entrance to the Strait of Dardanelles,
the ancient Hellespont, which connects the
Ægean Sea with the Sea of Marmora, the Turkish
fortifications crowning the hills on both sides of the
channel were plainly visible. Under the great guns of
the fortresses the Moltke anchored.</p>

<p>"Why do we stop here?" inquired one of the tourists
of the surgeon, who was standing near watching the
shore.</p>

<p>"This is the quarantine station," replied the doctor,
"and we must wait here for the official inspection.
According to Turkish regulations, the passage of foreign
warships through the Dardanelles is absolutely prohibited
at any time and merchant vessels are not allowed
to enter during the night. Every vessel arriving here
must undergo inspection before receiving a permit to
proceed. The Sultan guards this gateway to the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
vulnerable part of his dominion, not only to prevent the
entrance of a hostile fleet, but to protect his people from
the incursions of that insidious foe, the plague, which
sometimes ravages the Eastern countries. There come
the officials now in response to our signals," he added
as a yacht steamed out from the shore. "I must go
with the captain to welcome them at the head of the
gangway."</p>

<p>The Turkish quarantine physician in red fez and handsome
fur overcoat, accompanied by his assistants and
the inspector, came on board. Madam Rumor whispers
that a good sized tip sometimes obviates tedious personal
examinations and insures prompt issuance of a
clean bill of health without exasperating delays. However
it was, the quarantine physician, after consulting
with the ship physician, quickly found the health conditions
satisfactory, and the inspector of cargoes granted
his permit. The pilot who was to guide the vessel
through the swiftly flowing current of the Hellespont
joined us here, and with him came the dragoman or
chief guide who had been engaged by the managers to
take special charge of the sight-seeing excursions of our
party while in Constantinople.</p>

<p>Proceeding slowly on our way, we noticed half a dozen
Turkish warships lying in the stream near by. One who
claimed to know said that the Turkish naval vessels had
been gathering barnacles and mussels for four years and
were unfit for active service. But the fortresses guarding
the strait, he said, were in excellent condition and
well equipped with batteries of modern make.</p>

<p>The Strait of Dardanelles, for a distance of forty miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
separating the continent of Asia from that of Europe,
varies in width, narrowing to less than one mile at some
places and broadening out to four miles at others. By
referring to the steamer's atlas, consulting guide books,
exchanging historical knowledge, and questioning good-natured
officials, the tourists obtained information about
the various points of interest that they were passing.
Beyond the entrance, at the narrowest point of the
strait, the place was pointed out where the Persian king
Xerxes with his vast army crossed the channel on a
bridge of boats for the invasion of Europe in the year
480 B.C.</p>

<p>"Little then," remarked a tourist, "did that imperious
invader dream that within a year, in humiliation and
defeat, and with only a poor remnant of that great
army, he would recross that strait to Asia again."</p>

<p>At the same place in the channel, we were informed,
Alexander the Great with his Greek legions crossed
from Europe in the year 334 B.C. and continued his
victorious march until all the then known portion of
Asia was subdued to his rule.</p>

<p>"Then," said another tourist, "when flushed with
victory, he wept for other worlds to conquer. To me
the saddest part of Alexander's history is that he was
himself conquered by his own appetite and never
returned to his native shore."</p>

<p>Another tragic tale connected with that place is the
story of Hero and Leander. Across that mile of swiftly
flowing current, the story says, Leander nightly swam
from Abydos to the tower on the opposite shore to visit
his beloved Hero, the priestess of Venus. In one of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
nightly excursions the swimmer was drowned in a storm,
and Hero, after hearing of Leander's death, despairingly
threw herself into the sea to share his sad fate.</p>

<p>"There is the height from which Hero cast herself,"
said an official, "and this is the place where Lord Byron,
in emulation of Leander, performed the same difficult
feat of swimming the channel."</p>

<p>To the right, on the Asian shore not far away, was the
plain of Troy where Dr. Schlieman won fame by making
the excavations and discoveries which led to the location
of the lost city of Troy. In this ancient city of Troy,
according to Homer, the beautiful Grecian princess
Helen, abducted by Paris, the son of the King of Troy,
was detained for ten years. The enraged Greeks under
Ulysses and Ajax, seeking to rescue the princess, besieged
the city and finally succeeded in entering its
gates and accomplishing their purpose by means of the
stratagem of a huge wooden horse.</p>

<p>After sailing through the length of the Sea of Marmora,
about one hundred and ten miles, we arrived at five
o'clock in the evening within sight of the domes and
minarets that crown the promontory at the entrance
to the Strait of Bosporus. From the time we caught
our first glimpse of a distant minaret, until the anchor
of our steamer was dropped in the channel, every
tourist was intent on the picturesque views which
presented themselves. While the Moltke was steadily
moving onward and our point of view continually
changing, the dragoman at intervals pointed out the
various places of interest, now on one side, now on the
other.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Strait of Bosporus, which we are now approaching,
is here a little over a mile in width," said he. "The
part of the city you see on the headland on the north
shore of the Strait is the oldest part of Constantinople,
and is called Stamboul. It is occupied principally by
Turks, Greeks, Armenians, and Jews. The most celebrated
mosques, and also the great bazaars in which
tourists delight to wander, are in Stamboul."</p>

<p>"That dome with six minarets surrounding it, partially
hidden by the intervening trees and buildings, is
the Mosque of Ahmed, one of the most interesting in
the city. Beyond it you can see the dome and four minarets
of the more famous St. Sophia. The name of this
is probably familiar to you, for almost every visitor
whom I have escorted has told me that he had heard
of the Mosque of St. Sophia."</p>

<p>"And that is Scutari," he continued, calling our attention
to the city on the Asiatic shore of the strait. "The
great square yellow building so prominent on that side
is the military barracks. The large structure nearer
us is the military hospital where the English lady nursed
the soldiers during the war with Russia fifty years ago.
Perhaps you have heard of the lady?"</p>

<p>We informed the dragoman that the noble work of
Florence Nightingale during the Crimean war was well
known to the American people, and her name held in
high honor by them.</p>

<p>"The point beyond us on the left," said the guide a
few minutes later, "is called Seraglio Point. The
portion of the city on the promontory, extending along
the Bosporus, is about one mile in length and half a mile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
in width and is called the Seraglio. In these extensive
grounds are the well guarded Treasury buildings containing
the accumulated treasures of centuries, the Imperial
Museum of Antiquities, and many other public
edifices. There also are the palaces, kiosks, and gardens,
which were occupied by the Sultans and their families
until the present Sultan changed his residence to another
part of the city.</p>

<p>"The stream of water to our left," he added as our
steamer rounded Seraglio Point, "is called the Golden
Horn, so named on account of its curved shape. This
inlet of the Bosporus, not over one-third of a mile in
width, separates the older Stamboul from old Galata
and newer Pera. Over the two bridges across this
inlet streams of people pass constantly. Galata is the
business section of the city which includes the wharves,
steamship offices, and wholesale establishments. Pera,
situated on the heights above Galata, contains the
residences of the wealthier class, as well as hotels, modern
stores, and the residences of the ambassadors and consuls."</p>

<p>After passing the mouth of the Golden Horn, the
Moltke slackened speed and anchored in the Bosporus
apposite Galata, a little way from the shore. Prominent
on the shore at the water's edge, not far from our
anchorage, stood a small but beautiful white mosque
with delicate minarets, and just beyond it a snow white
palace of magnificent size.</p>

<p>"The white marble building that you see extending
for some distance along the Bosporus," said the guide,
"is the Dolmah Bagcheh Palace of the Sultan, one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
magnificent palaces which he does not occupy. Once
or twice a year he holds a reception there. In the distance
along the water is the Cheraghan Palace where the
imprisoned ex-Sultan Murad, the elder brother of the
present Sultan, for many years had every luxury but
liberty. And on the heights just beyond those grounds
is Yildiz Kiosk, the palace where now lives the present
ruler of Turkey, his Imperial Majesty, Sultan Abdul
Hamid. Strangers are not permitted to enter its
gates, but we have obtained his Imperial Majesty's
permission to take your party through the Dolmah
Bagcheh Palace."</p>

<p>Our steamer had barely anchored when a steam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
yacht flying the emblem of Turkey, a red flag with a
white crescent and star, appeared alongside. Several
red-fezzed Turkish officials, on whose green frock coats
dangled medals and badges, mounted the stairway to
receive the report of the vessel and examine and visé the
passports of the passengers. The stewards collected the
passports and handed them to the Sultan's officers,
who afterwards returned them stamped in queer-looking
characters with the official seal of the Turkish government.</p>

<p>"Captain, can you not send us ashore?" requested
some of the tourists after the evening dinner was over.</p>

<p>"I would gladly send you ashore if I considered it safe
for you to go," replied the Captain, "but I advise you
to remain on board. There is little to be seen after
sunset in this unlighted city. Although the principal
streets are lighted with gas, many of the streets depend
upon the moon and stars and so on cloudy nights are
left in utter darkness. Strangers may with safety
wander around the city during the day, but it is dangerous
for them to do so at night. The lower part of the
city along the wharves is infested with thieves who have
little regard for the life of an infidel, and who under cover
of darkness would cut one's throat and cast the body into
the stream in order to secure a few valuables."</p>

<p>The Captain's advice was taken and the evening was
delightfully spent on the vessel. The American Consul
and his wife came on board to meet some friends and
to welcome all the Americans. Then, according to a
plan which had been made by the managers of the tour,
a resident of the city delivered an instructive address on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
the history of Constantinople. The lecturer told of
Constantine the Great, first Christian emperor and
founder of the city; of Justinian, the imperial legislator
and builder, and his empress Theodora, the beautiful
comedian who became a queen; of the heroic warrior
Belisarius and his emperor's ingratitude; of the Greek
girl Irene who rose to supreme power; of the bloody
religious riots and theological disputes; of the Nicene
Council and adoption of the Nicene creed; and of the
pillage of Constantinople by the ruthless Crusaders.
He told also of the marriage ceremonies, of the art and
commerce, and of the places of interest about the city.
His remarks about the former trade and literature of the
city were most interesting.</p>

<p>"During the earlier centuries of the Eastern Roman
Empire," said the lecturer, "Constantinople, the capital,
was a great centre of trade, an exchange market for the
products of the world. Caravans brought the treasures
of the East to the storehouses here to be bartered for the
cargoes of produce which came in ships from the West.
This exchange brought wealth and prosperity to the
city. In later centuries the Venetians and Genoese
succeeded in transferring much of this business to
Venice and Genoa and the trade of Constantinople
declined. In modern days steamships and the Suez
canal have completely changed the route of commerce.</p>

<p>"Constantinople, not only was a centre of trade, but
in the Twelfth and Thirteenth centuries it was the
centre of literature. During the dark ages, when the
study of literature was generally neglected in other
places, the lamp of learning burned brightly in this city.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
Libraries were established and manuscripts accumulated;
but at the time of the Turkish invasion a multitude of
the most valuable documents were destroyed. When
the Renaissance brought new life to the western shores,
the centre of literature moved to Italy, and printed
books took the place of manuscripts."</p>

<p>When we thought of the present standing of Turkey
among the nations of the world, it was difficult to realize
that for centuries Constantinople was the commercial
centre and the brilliant capital of the world. It was
even more difficult to realize that the country which
now prohibits the importation of foreign books and
papers was at one time the patron of art, literature, and
learning, the collector of great libraries of illuminated
manuscripts, theological discourses, and legal documents.
But that was centuries ago.</p>

<p>Thursday morning ushered in a bright, clear, cool day.
We were up early, eager for sight-seeing, and little boats
soon carried us to the custom house pier on the Galata
side. Open carriages drawn by wiry Turkish horses
and driven by Turkish drivers were there in readiness
to carry us across the Golden Horn to explore the sights
of Stamboul. As our carriages rattled over the plank
pontoon bridge with its drawbridge in the center, we
passed through a crowd of people more varied as to
nationality and costume than can be seen at almost any
other place on the globe. The Turks, of course, predominated,
their nationality being indicated by the
national head-gear,&mdash;the red fez. The wealthier Turks
wore the English style of clothing and the red fez. The
costumes of the other classes varied according to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
occupation. On the bridge as our driver guided his
team through the throng, we saw Turkish soldiers in
blue uniforms and red fez; Moslems wearing a green
sash around the fez to indicate that they had performed
a pilgrimage to Mecca; stately-looking bearded Greek
priests in black robes and peculiar hats; Nubians with
black glistening skins and tattooed faces; Moslem
priests with pure white turbans, and Moslem priests
with high green turbans; Russian or Hungarian peasants
with coats of sheep skin, the fleecy sides of which were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
turned inward; Dervishes in brown mantles, and high-coned
brown hats without brims; Hebrews in long
yellow coats and little curls at the sides of their heads;
Turks in gold embroidered trousers and jackets and long
flowing blue sleeves; Turkish women with faces closely
veiled, and negro women who concealed their features
behind white veils in the same manner as the Turkish
women.</p>

<p>"Those cakes looked so good, I was almost tempted
to take one off the tray," said one of the occupants of our
carriage, as a peddler carrying on his head a table filled
with cakes and pastry passed so closely that his wares
were within reach.</p>

<p>"Oh, how could you think of doing such a thing,"
hastily exclaimed her companion, horrified at the
thought, "we should all be placed in a dungeon and our
pleasure ended."</p>

<p>Peddlers of dates, bearing their stock of fruit in huge
baskets on their backs and carrying scales in one hand,
held up a sample of dates towards us with the other
hand; dealers in nuts in the same manner carried and
offered their wares to the passers-by; peddlers of "Turkish
delight" and other sweetmeats arranged the
candies on their trays in an attractive manner; and the
sherbet sellers called attention to the pink liquid in
large glass bottles suspended on their backs. At each
end of the bridge were half a dozen toll collectors in long
white overshirts who stood in line across the way collecting
the toll of ten paras, or one cent, from each person
that crossed.</p>

<p>"How clearly that dome and the two minarets stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
out against the sky," exclaimed one of the party, pointing
to a great dome and two delicate minarets with tapering
peaks which rose above the buildings directly in
front of us on the other side of the bridge.</p>

<p>"That is the Mosque where the Sultans and their
families went to prayer when they resided in the Seraglio
near by. We will not stop at this Mosque but will go
directly to the Mosque of St. Sophia."</p>

<p>"Professor," said the lady who in Athens had confessed
her ignorance of history, "please give us some information
about the church of St. Sophia while we are
grouped here together in front of the building."</p>

<p>The professor expressed his willingness to do so, provided
we were willing to take the time to listen.</p>

<p>"In the year 532 A.D.," said he, "Justinian, the
Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, decided to erect
in Constantinople a church that should be a glory to the
city and an honor to his name. His desire was to build
one 'such as since Adam has never been seen,' a structure
differing in design from any Christian temple previously
constructed and surpassing in magnificence any temple
that afterwards might be built. The empire was then
at the height of its power and glory, and Justinian, in
emulation of Solomon, made demands on all the countries
under his dominion for contributions of ivory, cedar,
gold, silver, precious stones, and the rarest marbles.</p>

<p>"In order to attain his ambitious design, the monarch
robbed the Temple of the Sun at Baalbek of columns of
porphyry, despoiled the Temple of Diana of Ephesus of
its finest pillars, took columns of pure white marble from
the Temple of Minerva at Athens, and divested the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
shrines of Isis and Osiris in Egypt of their choicest
granite columns. He called upon the quarries of Italy,
Greece, and the Ægean Isles for marbles of every hue
produced by them, so that, when completed, the temple
should contain the most beautiful marbles the world
could yield, and these he ordered to be highly polished
and artistically arranged. To hasten the construction,
ten thousand workmen under the direction of one hundred
architects were employed, and in less than six years
the immense structure, 'the great Church of Santa
Sophia, or Heavenly Wisdom,' one of the most famous
churches of the world, was ready for dedication.</p>

<p>"The great altar was built of silver and gold, the seven
chairs of the bishops were plated with silver, the crosses
and crucifixes were composed of pure gold, and the altar
cloth and vestments were encrusted with precious stones.
Jeweled images of saints, sacred paintings of fabulous
value, and holy relics to be adored by kneeling worshipers,
were arranged around the walls of the building.
The huge doors of the temple were made of cedar,
ivory, amber, and silver; the ceiling glistened with
golden mosaics; the walls shone with polished marbles:
and the capitals of the columns were laced with delicate
carvings inset with mother-of-pearl, silver, and
precious stones.</p>

<p>"On the day of the dedication of the temple a jubilant
procession of patriarchs, bishops, priests, and people, in
admiring wonder, entered the completed building with
songs and rejoicings. The Emperor, at the head of the
procession, overcome with pride and joy in the glorious
consummation of his purpose, threw himself upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
floor and exultingly exclaimed: 'Glory to God who has
deemed me worthy to accomplish so great a work. O
Solomon, I have surpassed thee!'</p>

<p>"In this sanctuary for over nine centuries the people
worshiped God according to the Christian faith in
great pomp and with much ceremony. The bishops
officiated at the golden altar reading from golden lettered
manuscripts, and were assisted in the service by scores
of richly robed priests and hundreds of selected musicians,
while the air was filled with the fragrance of rising
incense. But during the latter part of the Middle Ages
while the power and glory of the Roman Empire was
gradually declining, the rival Mohammedan Turkish
Empire in Asia was rapidly ascending to a dominant
position. Finally, in the year 1453 A.D., the Sultan of
Asiatic Turkey, Muhammed II, determined to obtain
possession of Constantinople and make the city the
capital of his empire. His army besieged the decadent
city and captured it after a struggle of fifty-three days.
When the Turkish troops entered in triumph they tore
the emblems of Christianity from their places and, instead
of the cross of the Christian, they raised the crescent of
the Moslem.</p>

<p>"In the church of St. Sophia the conquerors tore
down the golden altar, melted the silver plates, removed
the images of saints, painted over the sacred pictures,
and took away the jewels and precious stones, changing
the interior to suit the simpler worship of the followers
of Mahomet. The name of the building was changed
and it was thereafter known as the Mosque of Saint
Sophia. For four hundred and fifty years the Mosque<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
has been in possession of the Turks. Its doors are open
at all times for Moslems to enter freely; but the entrance
is carefully guarded to keep Christian or foreign visitors
from intruding. The latter, however, may gain admission
by paying an entrance fee of forty cents, and
removing their shoes at the door or lacing over their
shoes the loose slippers that are provided for this purpose."</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>On the porch of the Mosque we put our feet into the
loose slippers, a Moslem attendant tied them on as carefully
as the clumsy things could be tied, and then, accompanied
by him, we entered the building. The immense
floor, an acre in size, was covered with handsome
heavy rugs. As we slid, rather than walked, over the
soft Turkish carpets, our turbaned guide, with sharp,
piercing, black eyes, watched carefully to see that our
slippers did not become unfastened and drop off, and our
infidel shoes profane the holy enclosure. And when one
of the visitors laughed within the sacred edifice, the
attendant's black eyes flashed with anger.</p>

<p>It was not the regular hour for prayer in the mosque,
but a number of worshipers were devoutly kneeling
at different places in the interior, with faces turned
toward a black stone in the south wall, which indicated
the direction of the holy city of Mecca. Others,
squatting on their bare heels, were reading or reciting
in monotonous tones parts of the Koran. There are
no benches or chairs in the building; Moslem worshipers
do not require seats while at their devotions. The
great dome, over one hundred feet in width, rises in
grandeur one hundred and eighty feet overhead, supported
by four huge columns each seventy feet in circumference.
A circle of windows, forty-four in number,
around the dome illumines the golden mosaics which
cover the ceiling. A mosaic picture in the dome
representing the Almighty, has been obliterated by the
Turks and covered with green linen cloth. A verse
from the Koran, in gilt Arabic characters almost thirty
feet long, is painted on this cloth. The sentence, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
translated, begins: "God is the light of heaven and
earth," and ends, "God alone sheddeth His light on
whomsoever He pleaseth."</p>

<p>"If the Moslems believe in the Bible and in God as a
supreme being, why did they destroy the mosaic representation
of God on the ceiling?" inquired one of the
visitors.</p>

<p>"The Moslems do believe in the Bible and in one
Supreme God," was the reply, "and it was this very
belief that led them to paint out the picture of God
and to destroy all the images and paintings of saints;
for God's command is: 'Thou shalt not make unto thee
any graven image, or any likeness of anything that is in
the heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath,
or that is in the water under the earth. Thou shalt not
bow down thyself to them.'"</p>

<p>"The Moslems," continued the guide, "regard
Mahomet as the Prophet of God, and the Koran as
written by him under the inspiration of God; but they
do not worship Mahomet or any image or picture of
him."</p>

<p>We paused to admire the four green marble columns
taken from the Temple of Diana, and the polished shafts
brought from the Temple of the Sun, relics of those two
magnificent cities, Ephesus and Baalbek, of whose
grandeur nothing now remains but broken stones. We
gazed upward at the eight immense green shields
covered with Arabic characters, high above our heads
on the walls. But we doubted the miraculous healing
power of a small hole that is always damp in a bronze-covered
pillar, and hesitated also to accept the tradition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
that the apparent imprint of a bloody hand in the marble
wall was made by the Sultan Muhammed II when he
rode into St. Sophia after the capture of the city.</p>

<p>"On Fridays," said the guide, as we stood at the foot
of the marble steps that led to the elevated pulpit, "the
priest, clad in a long red robe, reads a prayer for the
Sultan, and, while doing so, holds in one hand the Koran
and in the other a drawn sword to indicate that this
temple was captured from the Christians by force."</p>

<p>"That prayer rug," he continued pointing to a
beautiful carpet hanging on the wall near by, "was the
personal prayer rug of the great conqueror Muhammed
II. There is so much more to be seen," he added,
"that we could spend the whole day here, but the
dragoman is beckoning and we must go on."</p>

<p>We shook the slippers from our feet in the porch and
were driven through narrow streets to the Grand Bazaar.</p>

<p>"The Grand Bazaar," said the guide, "covers several
acres. It has one hundred entrances. There are
twelve hundred narrow streets or passages under roof
within the bazaar and on these streets are four thousand
little shops."</p>

<p>The Grand Bazaar, we decided, was the enormous
department store of Stamboul; but we noticed that
each little shop had its own proprietor. To many of the
visitors, this Bazaar was the most interesting place in
Constantinople; for here were found the most tempting
bargains in Oriental wares, in its narrow passages were
seen the native people in their most picturesque costumes,
and in its maze of dimly lighted corridors some tourists
were lost for awhile and met with novel adventures.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>The store of Far-Away-Moses was one of the largest
and most popular of the shops in the Bazaar and that
genial trader did a thriving business. There seemed
to be a magnetic power that drew the guides in the
direction of certain shops, an unseen influence that
urged them to recommend certain places, and one of
these places was Moses' emporium. Some of the ladies
found that when they slipped away and entered a shop
without a guide a better bargain could be secured.</p>

<p>The price named for articles in the bazaar shops by
the fezzed or turbaned dealers was generally three times
the price that they would accept before losing a sale;
but much tact was required on the part of the purchaser,
and much valuable time was occupied in the diplomatic
struggles between the acute Yankees and clever Moslems.
When, however, the battle was won and the
desired article secured at one-half or one-third the price
at first demanded, the joy of the purchaser was doubled.
The person, who, after an hour's dickering, bought a
bronze ornament for twenty piasters, or one dollar of
American money, was just as happy over the bargain
as the one who succeeded in purchasing a magnificent
silk rug for twenty thousand piasters. The money
drawers of the Moslem traders were swollen with their
contents but their shelves were less crowded when the
Americans left the bazaar.</p>

<p>When we returned to the vessel we found that during
our absence the decks had been converted into a rival
bazaar. The tourists who had failed to obtain souvenirs
had another opportunity to buy them; for here were
displayed silk rugs ranging in price from three thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
piasters downward, exquisite embroideries, rare silks,
delicate fans, gold-laced shawls, fragrant attar of roses,
and a multitude of articles in bronze, silver, and gold.</p>

<p>"How restful it is to recline lazily in our comfortable
steamer chairs rolled up in a rug, dreaming or talking
over the events of the day, without any cares or worries
to disturb our thoughts," remarked one of our friends
as we sat upon the deck in the later evening hours
watching the glimmering lights on the shore.</p>

<p>"Yes," said another, "there seems to be nothing to
disturb the serenity of the night; even the distant
barking of the dogs appears to be in harmony with the
soft lapping of the waves against the vessel. I feel that
I shall rest to-night in my berth, as Shakespeare says,
in a 'sleep that knits the ravel'd sleeve of care,' after the
exertion of a full day of sight-seeing."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p class="center">THE SELAMLIK AND THE TREASURY.</p>


<p>One dark night in the faraway past, so the story
runs, the barking of dogs in the outskirts of Constantinople
wakened the sleeping garrison in the
city, warning them of the approach of a crafty foe who
sought to surprise and capture the place. At the same
time, the young moon, coming out from under a cloud,
revealed the position of the enemy. The barking of the
dogs and the light of the crescent moon enabled the garrison
to frustrate the designs of their foes and save the
capital from capture. Since then the nightly howlings
of the dogs have been tolerated by the Turkish people
and the crescent has had a place of honor on the Turkish
banner. To kill a dog is an unpardonable offense.
The dogs, however, are not well fed, well groomed pets,
fondled, kissed, collared, and blanketed, as in some
other countries; but are ownerless, homeless creatures
roaming at night in great numbers through the streets
and sleeping by day on the thoroughfares and sidewalks
regardless of passers-by. The people step over or go
around the sleeping animals and do not disturb them.
The dogs seem to know their privileges, for they will not
move out of the way.</p>

<p>The city is noted for its dogs, not on account of their
beauty or breed, for they are a disreputable lot of mongrel
curs and bear the marks of many nightly brawls,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
but on account of the legions of them and their usefulness
as scavengers. At nightfall the residents of Stamboul
empty their garbage cans in the streets and the dogs,
howling and fighting, dispose of every scrap before daylight.
When a Turk desires to express the utmost
contempt for a person he calls him a dog.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

title="THE DOG FIGHT HAD JUST ENDED." />
<span class="caption">THE DOG FIGHT HAD JUST ENDED.</span>
</div>

<p>"If you wish to avoid trouble while in this city,"
cautioned the dragoman, "neither disturb a sleeping dog
in the highways,&mdash;for the dog will resent the interference
with his slumbers,&mdash;nor call a Turk a dog, for the
anger of a Turk thus reviled is uncontrollable until the
offender who called him by that vilest of epithets is
severely punished."</p>

<p>A drive of one and a half miles along the Grand Rue
de Galata, one of the wider thoroughfares in Galata
parallel to the Bosporus, carried the tourists from the
custom house pier to the gates of the Dolmah Bagcheh
Palace. The entrance to the grounds of the palace
is through a gateway of marble, beautiful in design and
richly ornamented with elaborate Corinthian columns
and delicate carvings of garlands, wreaths, and urns.</p>

<p>While we gazed at the carvings, the officer in charge
of the guard carefully examined our permit. Then the
massive gates were swung open for our entrance. Within
the palace we ascended a magnificent wide marble
staircase, the balusters of which were made of clear
glass. We admired the intricately carved alabaster
bath-rooms and wondered if their neatness had ever
been disturbed. We passed through a multitude of
richly decorated chambers and salons where every
article was arranged in perfect order, and walked on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
carpet strips laid for visitors' feet around the beautiful
ball-room, not daring to tread on the highly polished
hard-wood floor. Every apartment of the palace was
immaculate, and resplendent in marble, porcelain, inlaid
woods, and golden mosaics. The largest mirror in the
world reflected the passers-by and costly paintings
attracted the eyes of the visitors. The dark green malachite
and the rich blue lapis lazuli harmonized pleasingly
with yellow gold and white marble. And yet this
grand show palace is unoccupied except by the hundreds
of care-takers required to keep it in order. Its quiet
is disturbed only by sight-seers who pay for the privilege
of inspecting the stately apartments, and, on rare
occasions, by imperial receptions which are held in the
throne room. This immense apartment surpasses all
the others in the elegance of its adornment. The dome
overhead and the walls and the Corinthian columns
which surround the room are richly decorated with
oriental designs in white and gold. From the centre
of the dome hangs a crystal chandelier noted for its size
and beauty.</p>

<p>"In this throne room," said the guide, "five thousand
persons can stand. On the day after the close of the
Fast of Ramazan, which is the first day of the Feast
of Bairam, the Sultan drives here from Yildiz Palace,
along a road lined with soldiers, and holds a State
reception. Several thousand of the nobility assemble
in this room and the Sultan, seated on that crimson
and gold sofa, receives the homage of his officials. The
generals of the army in gorgeous uniforms, the heads
of the religious orders, holy men, and state officials<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
approach according to their rank and make their obeisance
to his Imperial Majesty. They reverently kiss
the hem of his Majesty's garment, press the hem to their
foreheads as a seal of their declaration of loyalty to his
person, and then retire backward from his presence.
During the reception every face in the assembly is
turned toward the Sultan. To turn one's back to his
Majesty, even for a moment, is unpardonable. That
day after Ramazan is a great day in the city; cannons
thunder, the bands play, the mosques are illuminated
at night, and the people feast and rejoice."</p>

<span class="caption">A TEAM OF GREAT HORNED OXEN.</span>
</div><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>"What is the Fast of Ramazan and when does it
occur?"</p>

<p>"The Fast of Ramazan," replied the guide, "is kept
through the whole month of Ramazan, which corresponds
to your month of September. For thirty days
the Moslems do not eat bread nor drink water during
the hours between sunrise and sunset. After sunset
they may refresh themselves. The Prophet commanded
that one specially named day in the month of Ramazan
should be kept as a fast day; but the date of that particular
day was somehow lost, and now, in order to make
sure of keeping the fast on the day appointed, the Moslems
keep every day in that month as a fast day. The
Feast of Bairam immediately follows the end of the
fasting. This festival consists of three days of feasting
and festivities."</p>

<p>Friday is the Mohammedan Sabbath, but we could
not see that it made much difference in the traffic of the
city. We asked the guide if the Turkish bazaars would
be closed.</p>

<p>"No," he replied, "but more of the faithful attend
mosque on Friday than on other days, and on Friday
each week the Sultan goes to his special mosque with
great ceremony."</p>

<p>The Sultan's weekly visit to prayer is called the Selamlik
or Sultan's Procession to Mosque. Our guide obtained
a good position for our carriage in an open square
near the mosque from which to see the procession. The
parade was not to occur until one o'clock, but in order
to secure the place we were there at eleven. The time
of waiting was not tiresome as there was much of interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
going on around us all the time. Carriages of other
visitors assembled in the open square; cabs containing
invited dignitaries rolled up to the ruler's palace, which
was within sight about one block away; guards drove
the crowds from the streets; regiments of red-fezzed
infantry tramped by and formed in lines along the street
between the palace and the mosque; mounted lancers
with flying pennons trotted to their positions; and the
bands took their place near the palace. Uniformed
policemen and spies in plain clothes circulated among
the carriages and sight-seers, watching closely for suspicious
characters, and listening to remarks made by
visitors. We were advised by our dragoman not to
mention the name of the Sultan.</p>

<p>"How the Turks do enjoy their coffee," said an occupant
of our carriage, calling attention to a group
squatting on the ground with cups in hand.</p>

<p>Near our carriage a Turk was making coffee on a
portable stove and selling the beverage to thirsty
customers; an itinerant barber placed his portable stool
beside our carriage wheel, opened his kit of tools and was
soon busy lathering and shaving dusky faces; a water
peddler with his jar on his back played a tune on tumblers
by rubbing them with his fingers; a cake peddler's
table was upset by passing dragoons and he mournfully
picked up the fragments. The trays of the Turkish
peddlers of candies and cakes were clean and the articles
offered appeared fresh and appetizing. We
yielded to temptation and bought some "Turkish delight"
and some light flaky biscuit, and, after eating
the dainties, wished for more.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

</div><p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is nearly one o'clock," said the guide looking at
his watch.</p>

<p>The street cleaners were hastily giving a final polish
to the roadway over which the Sultan would drive between
the lines of soldiers. A dozen carts filled with
clean sand that had been standing near us were hurried
up the hill and the white sand was spread over the
Sultan's path. The bands ceased playing; the soldiers
stood at attention; the Muezzin called to prayer; a
trumpet sounded from the gates; and from the palace
on the hill carriages emerged containing the veiled wives
of the ruler attended by black eunuchs on horseback.
A long line of military officers in handsome uniforms
followed on foot; then a shout arose from the assembled
troops, and a carriage appeared drawn by a very handsome
pair of horses in gold-mounted harness. In the
carriage the Sultan sat alone. The huzzas of the troops
continued until his Majesty entered the mosque. Then
all was silent, for the Sultan was at his prayers alone.
His wives and his officials had been left at the entrance.
No person was permitted to enter. The Iman, or priest
in charge, and the Sultan were the only occupants of the
mosque.</p>

<p>Without waiting for the ruler's return the visitors
hastened away, the carriages raising such a cloud of dust
that it was difficult to see across the road. A hasty
luncheon in a Pera restaurant followed, and then we
turned toward Stamboul. As we drove again across
the Galata bridge through the ever interesting throng
of humanity that crowds over it, our attention was called
to the manner in which merchandise is conveyed through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
the narrow streets of the city. Wagons are rarely used,
but men carry the merchandise on their backs and
shoulders. These men passed us laden with immense
bales of hides, huge bundles of carpets and rugs, large
boxes of dry-goods, great crates of fruits or vegetables,
piles of trunks, barrels
and sacks of groceries, and cans
of oil. The ponderous
burdens
were heaped upon
wooden frames fitted
to the backs
and strapped to
the shoulders of
the carriers. When
the load was too
heavy for one man
to carry, it was
suspended on poles
and carried by two
or more of the
bearers.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;WHAT A CONTRAST,&quot; SHE SAID.</span>
</div>

<p>A high wall surrounds
the old Seraglio grounds.
Before visitors may enter a permit must be obtained.
A permit including the necessary fees to the keepers
costs small parties of visitors about five dollars each; the
permit and fees for the Molkte party, so it was rumored,
cost the managers two hundred dollars. The captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
of the guard at the gate scrutinized our permit and kept
us waiting until an official was summoned to act as our
conductor. When we arrived at the Treasury building
the huge door was opened with impressive ceremony and
the uniformed officials kept the tourists under close
surveillance while they were within.</p>

<p>Among the many curiosities that attracted attention
in the first room of the Treasury was a throne captured
from one of the Shahs of Persia four hundred years ago.
This Persian throne is made of beaten gold inlaid with
rubies and emeralds, and is said to be of fabulous value.
Arranged in glass cases in another room a row of figures
represents the Sultans of past ages clothed in the royal
attire worn by them. The white turbans of these
effigies are ablaze with jewels. The mantles which
cover them are of Oriental brocade wrought in gold and
silver patterns, and the belts, swords, and daggers are
adorned with sparkling gems. A suit of chain armor
worn by one of the Sultans of olden times is ornamented
with gold and diamonds. On the second floor of the
Treasury, to which we ascended by a narrow stairway,
the most carefully guarded treasure is a throne used
by a former Turkish ruler. This Turkish throne is
made of precious wood inlaid with tortoise shell, mother
of pearl, and gold and silver traceries, and is set with
turquoises. A canopy overspreads the throne, and
beneath the canopy, suspended by a golden cord, hangs
an enormous pear-shaped emerald. In cases around the
various rooms, crowns, sceptres, simitars, swords, daggers,
and talismans, scintillate with rubies, emeralds,
and diamonds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>"Many of the highly valued treasures stored in these
rooms," said our friend, the professor, "are trophies of
the times when Crusader knight, Persian prince, and
Saracen warrior went forth to battle arrayed in costly
apparel, and encamped under silken canopies or in
tents of cloth of gold. Then jeweled balls suspended
from golden cords adorned the tent poles of the warriors,
and luxury and opulence abounded underneath the canopies.
The royalty of kings and princes moved with
them to the field of war. Under pavilions of Oriental
weave, silken carpets were spread over the turf for royal
feet to tread, and thrones erected from which the sovereigns
issued their commands. Retinues of retainers
rendered obeisance and executed the mandates of their
lords. Caravans of camels laden with robes of royalty
and chests of treasure moved from camp to camp.</p>

<p>"Knights and warriors vied with each other in the
splendor of their equipage. The trappings of their war
steeds were embroidered in silk and gold; the breastplates
and helmets which protected their bodies were
embossed with silver or traced with gold; the scabbards
and hilts of their weapons were encrusted with precious
stones; and their mantles were clasped with fastenings
and buckles adorned with jewels. In battle the body
of a dead knight gave much booty to the slayer; the
capture of a canopy enriched the captors; and the defeat
of an army and seizure of its camp gave to the victors
a train of spoils.</p>

<p>"For several centuries, the Turkish empire was
dominant in the East and its armies victorious in the
field. It was during these centuries of power that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
Moslem rulers gathered the great accumulation of
trophies and spoils of war, valued at untold millions,
which we find stored in the rooms of this marble edifice."</p>

<p>After leaving the Treasury we were led by the official
conductor past the building in which the mantle, sword,
and green banner of the great founder of Mohammedanism
are treasured. These personal relics of the Prophet
are considered by the Moslems too sacred to be gazed
upon by infidel eyes.</p>

<p>We tarried awhile in the Bagdad Kiosk, a white
marble palace noted for its interior wall decoration of
blue tiling, beautiful doors inlaid with mother of pearl,
and handsome furniture inlaid with inscriptions of silver,
and thence proceeded to a marble pavilion in which, as
guests of the absent Sultan, we partook of refreshments.
These refreshments, consisting of Turkish coffee in tiny
cups and Turkish preserves on small plates, were
brought to us by the servants of the Sultan. We stood
awhile on the portico in the rear of the pavilion and
admired the magnificent view of the harbor with its
shipping, and the surrounding shores covered with
buildings.</p>

<p>Leaving the portico and its panoramic view with regret,
we turned to the Museum of Antiquities, intending
to inspect hastily the relics of ancient times which it
contains. The collection, however, proved to be much
more interesting than we had expected, so, instead of
hurriedly passing through the building, we lingered
around the sarcophagi and studied the hunting and
battle scenes which were exquisitely carved on the
polished marble of the exteriors of the old stone coffins.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
The most beautiful of these sarcophagi, twenty-one in
number, have been discovered within the past thirty
or forty years at Sidon in Syria. The tireless archæologists,
eager in pursuit of knowledge of the past,
found and opened the graves in which the dead kings
of Sidon had quietly rested for thousands of years; then
disinterring the heavy stone caskets they brought them
to Constantinople to be placed on exhibition.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

title="THE STREET CARS IN PERA ARE DOUBLE-DECKED." />
<span class="caption">THE STREET CARS IN PERA ARE DOUBLE-DECKED.</span>
</div>

<p>These sarcophagi are stone caskets of great size and
weight composed of two pieces, the chest and lid. The
chest is hewn out of one solid block of marble and the
lid of another. The sarcophagi range from ten to twelve
feet in length, from five to six feet in width, and from
six to eight feet in height. One of the stone coffins, made
of black Egyptian marble and named the Tabnith, contained,
when found, the dried up mummy of an ancient
king, Tabnith, who lived four centuries before the time
of Christ. An inscription on this in Egyptian hieroglyphics
pronounced a curse upon the man who should despoil
the tomb, but the dreadful warning was not deciphered
until the casket reached the Museum. Another
sarcophagus, called the Satrap's, cut out of Parian
marble, somewhat resembles a Grecian temple in form.
On the sides are depicted, in marble carvings, a funeral
banquet, a governor on his throne, a hunting scene with
a lion at bay, a frightened horse dragging its dismounted
rider, and many other similar scenes.</p>

<p>"But this, in my opinion, is the most attractive
casket in the collection," said the professor as we came
to one named the Weepers, on the marble sides of which
a master sculptor of ancient times had carved eighteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
female forms. "Notice how each figure is portrayed in
a different graceful attitude of mourning and how each
is a picture of sorrow. And notice, too, the exquisite
workmanship of the frieze with its ornamentation of a
hundred small figures in hunting scenes."</p>

<span class="caption">WE FED THE PIGEONS AT THE PIGEON MOSQUE.</span>
</div>

<p>Near to the Weepers is the sarcophagus known as the
Alexander, the most famous in the collection, by many
considered the most beautiful in the world, and in the
opinion expressed by the American Consul in Constantinople,
"worth crossing the ocean to see." The sculptures
on this represent a battle between Greeks and
Persians with many figures and incidents of battle, and
elaborate hunting scenes with many details delicately
worked out. These four sarcophagi, and the one named
the Lycian on which Amazons in four horse chariots
hunting lions are delineated, attracted the most attention
from the tourists, but there were scores of other
sarcophagi in the collection almost as interesting.</p>

<p>In another part of the Museum, called the China
Pavilion, the noted stone tablet from the Temple of
Jerusalem was on exhibition. This tablet, discovered
at Jerusalem in the year 1871, originally stood in the
Temple enclosure to mark the limit which Gentiles were
not allowed to pass. The Greek inscription on the
tablet is translated as follows:</p>

<p>"No Gentile may pass beyond the railing into the
court round the Temple; he who is caught trespassing
will bring death upon himself."</p>

<p>Statues, pottery, porcelain, jewels, and antiquities of
various kinds were hurriedly passed by until an exclamation
of one of the ladies caused us to pause.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>"Look at his eyes," she said, pointing to a bronze
statue of Jupiter. "Did you ever see any eyes like that
in a statue?"</p>

<p>The eyes of the god were represented by two bright
rubies which gave them a very peculiar expression.
This room contained many exquisite pieces of bronze
work; one representing Hercules was particularly fine
in execution.</p>

<p>"We will stop now to view the Hippodrome," said
the guide, after driving a short distance from the Museum.</p>

<p>"But where is the Hippodrome?" inquired a tourist
as we descended from the carriages in a long open square.</p>

<p>"Alas! the building is no more," sadly replied the
guide. "This square is a part of the ground on which it
stood. The space was originally very long and wide,
but that great Mosque of Ahmed and other buildings
now occupy a large portion of the old circus grounds.</p>

<p>"The ancient Hippodrome was an oblong enclosure
fourteen hundred feet long and four hundred feet wide,
surrounded by magnificent porticos adorned with statues
of marble and bronze, and had a seating capacity of
eighty thousand. It was used for chariot races, athletic
sports, and bloody gladiatorial combats. Sometimes the
seats were crowded with people, now assembled to glory
in the triumphal procession of a returning conqueror,
now to gloat over the burning of heretics and criminals
who had been condemned to death by the flames.</p>

<p>"That high red granite obelisk covered with hieroglyphics
at the end of the square is called the Obelisk
of Theodosius the Great. It was originally erected in
the Temple of the Sun in Egypt in 1600 B.C. by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
haughty king who inscribed on the stone a statement
that he had 'conquered the whole world,' and that his
'royalty was as firm as that of the gods in the sky.' For
two thousand years the obelisk remained in Heliopolis
as a memorial of its builder, Thotmes III, but for the
past fifteen hundred years it has stood here as a monument
to the Emperor Theodosius, who brought it from
Egypt as a trophy. In order that he might not be forgotten,
the Emperor caused a representation of himself
surrounded by courtiers, guards, and dancing girls to
be carved on the base of the obelisk. These sculptures,
as you see, are in good condition. The bronze 'Serpent
Column' in the centre of the square, representing three
serpents coiled around each other, once supported the
tripod used in the ceremonial services of the Pythian
oracle at Delphi."</p>

<p>When the guide had finished his remarks, our friend,
the professor, stepped forward and said: "Some of the
tourists may not be familiar with the story of the horses
that lived as long and traveled as far as did the 'Wandering
Jew' in Eugene Sue's well known romance. The
conductor has requested me to relate the story."</p>

<p>"In some ancient time before the Christian era, a
Roman conqueror found in an Oriental city four magnificent
horses that pleased him. He took them to
Rome to grace his triumph. Centuries later the
covetous Emperor Constantine brought these same
horses from Rome to Constantinople and stood them
here to add glory to the splendor of his Hippodrome.
For nine hundred years the horses remained undisturbed;
then ruthless Christian Crusaders carried them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
with other spoils to Venice. A long rest at Venice
succeeded until the ambitious Bonaparte drew them
away to beautify his famous Capitol. After the downfall
of Napoleon the prayers of the Venetians were
effectual in bringing the horses away from Paris, and now
these gilded
bronze travelers,
that
were coveted
and prized by
great rulers of
the world,
stand in front
of the Church
of San Marco
in the city of
Venice."</p>

<p>As the professor
ceased
speaking, a
clear penetrating
voice
was heard
from overhead
crying:</p>

<p>"Al-la-hu,
Ak-bar! Al-la-hu, Ak-bar!" uttering each syllable distinctly.</p>

<p>It was the Muezzin calling the people to prayer.
Looking up we saw him on a little balcony near the
summit of a minaret which stood within the enclosure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
of the adjoining Mosque of Ahmed. Then he disappeared
and we heard more faintly his call from the
farther side of the balcony. It is the Muezzin's duty to
repeat his calls from the four sides of the minaret, to
north, east, south, and west. His words were interpreted
for us: "God is great," repeated four times on
each side of the minaret.</p>

<p>Faithful Moslems on hearing the call repeated his
words.</p>

<p>"There is no God but God," he called again, reciting
it twice.</p>

<p>His hearers repeated this declaration.</p>

<p>"Mohammed is the prophet of God."</p>

<p>The people responded in the same words.</p>

<p>"Come to prayer."</p>

<p>"I have no power or strength but from God most
high and great," all true believers replied.</p>

<p>"Come to do good," again the Muezzin called.</p>

<p>"What God wills will be; what he wills not will not
be," answered the people, all responses being muttered
in low tones.</p>

<p>"The ringing of bells to call the people to service is
forbidden," said the guide. "It is written that when
the Mohammedan meetings were first held in Arabia,
there was difficulty in gathering the people together and
propositions were made to 'Ring a bell as the Christians
do,' and to 'Blow the trumpets as do the Jews;' but
Omar cried, 'What! is there not a man among you who
can call to prayer?' The prophet then said, 'O Billal!
stand and make the call to prayer.' Since then the
melodious voices of the trained Muezzins five times each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
day summon the Moslems to prayer, and the tall graceful
minarets which rise above the surrounding buildings
were erected so that the voices could ring out over the
city."</p>

<p>We followed the faithful into the mosque, after paying
our fees and donning the slippers, and stood quietly
in the rear of the great auditorium. The interior was
brightened by beautiful blue and white tiling which
lined the arches overhead and covered the immense
piers that supported the roof. Inside the mosque,
near the entrance, water was running from spigots into
stone basins. The Moslems stopped at the basins and
washed their hands and feet. Some of the better dressed
worshipers appeared to have slippers inside their shoes
and went through the motion of washing the feet,
but the poorer classes used the water to cleanse their
feet, and then walked forward barefooted on the rugs.
Each man,&mdash;for there were no women at the service,&mdash;carried
his shoes with him and placed them upon a
board on the floor provided for that purpose.</p>

<p>The Koran, the sacred book, which, as the Moslems
claim, was revealed to Mahomet by the angel Gabriel
and was written by Mahomet under inspiration, commands:</p>

<p>"The clothes and person of the worshiper must be
clean, the place free from all impurity, and the face turned
toward Mecca." And also:</p>

<p>"O believers! when ye address yourselves to prayer
wash your hands up to the elbows, and wipe your heads,
and your feet to the ankles."</p>

<p>The worshipers, scattered around the vast interior,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
all facing the black stone in the wall which indicates the
direction of Mecca, repeated their prayers in low tones.
At first they stood with hands close at their sides, then
as they muttered the prescribed formulas the hands were
raised to the sides of the heads, then with hands clasped
in front the worshipers remained for a short time in
devout attention. After bowing several times the
Moslems knelt on the Oriental rugs continuing the
muttered supplications and concluded their personal
devotions by bowing forward on their feet. The Iman,
or priest, then ascended the pulpit, the worshipers
formed in lines, and as the priests read the prayers,
they went through the same movements that they had
previously made while at their personal devotions.</p>

<p>"Women do not take any part in the public worship
on the floor of the mosque," said the guide. "The latticed
galleries are provided for them. There they may
sit in privacy during the service. The galleries, however,
are rarely occupied."</p>

<p>The Mosque of Ahmed has six minarets; St. Sophia,
only four. The minarets, slender, round towers, are
not attached to the main edifices, but stand separate
and distinct in the courts surrounding the mosques, with
some space intervening between mosque and minaret.</p>

<p>Resuming our drive through the very narrow streets
of Stamboul, which are paved with large rough cobble
stones once laid in place but now very much out of place,
we passed many old unpainted frame buildings with
stove pipes projecting from the windows of the second
and third floors.</p>

<p>"I do not wish any one ill," said a tourist who at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
home was chief of a city Fire Department, "but I would
give a ten dollar gold piece if I could see how the fire
department of this old city manages to control or extinguish
a conflagration after it has gained headway
among these tinder boxes. The watchmen on the watch
towers surely cannot locate a fire and give the alarm
until they see a smoke or flame arising."</p>

<span class="caption">CAMEL AND DONKEY WERE BEDECKED WITH TRAPPINGS.</span>
</div>

<p>The fountains of the city were one of the peculiar
Turkish institutions that attracted the tourists' attention.
The Koran enjoins all true believers to abstain from
intoxicants, and to perform regular ablutions before
prayers; so there are drinking fountains at corners
where the thirsty assemble to drink from brass cups, and
washing fountains or basins outside and adjoining the
mosques, as well as inside these buildings, where Moslems
were seen washing hands or feet regardless of our
curious eyes. Some of the drinking fountains are very
large and beautiful. The fountain erected by Sultan
Ahmed surpasses all others in grace of proportion and
beauty of design. This magnificent structure is ornamented
with carved arabesques, inscriptions in gilt, and
delicately colored green tile. Above the water tap may
be seen in Turkish characters the builder's mandate:</p>

<p>"Wayfarer, admire this beautiful work; turn the tap
in the name of Allah; drink thy fill and bless the
founder, Ahmed Khan."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p class="center">FROM THE BOSPORUS TO PALESTINE.</p>


<p>The program posted for Saturday, February twenty-eighth,
announced that the Moltke would leave
Constantinople at nine o'clock in the morning for
a trip to the Black Sea, a distance of thirty-five miles.
As we sailed up the Bosporus, which narrows and widens,
twists and turns, a succession of picturesque scenes
opened up before us. Scattered along the shores, which
for fifteen or twenty miles beyond Constantinople may
be considered suburbs of that city, white marble palaces
of the rulers, summer residences of the foreign ambassadors,
and villas of the wealthy Turks were seen interspersed
with modern villages and ruined walls and castles
of past ages. Pretty frame summer houses, groves
of dark green cypress, gardens, boat-houses, and
mosques added interest to the views.</p>

<p>"The sail up the Bosporus reminds me of one taken
on the Hudson River, but the scenery on the banks is
Oriental instead of modern," remarked one of the
tourists.</p>

<p>"The old castles and ruined walls, and the legends connected
with them, suggest the Rhine," commented
another.</p>

<p>At the water's edge on the Asiatic side, a few miles
from the city, we saw the beautiful white marble Beylerbey
Palace, built in the year 1866 by Abdul-Aziz,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
the predecessor of the present Sultan, as a residence for
his harem. For their pleasure he surrounded the palace
with groves and gardens and established a menagerie in
the grounds. About eight miles from the city all eyes
were turned toward a hill on the European shore, where,
above a cluster of buildings, the Stars and Stripes
floated in the breeze.</p>

<p>"That is the American College, which is doing good
work in Turkey. It was founded by Mr. A. Robert
of New York, and is known as the 'Robert College,'"
said the guide.</p>

<span class="caption">THE TURKISH STUDENTS WAVED HATS AND FLAGS.</span>
</div>

<p>As our steamer passed the college, the Turkish
students from roof, windows, and campus waved hats,
handkerchiefs, and flags, and cheered energetically,
and the tourists waved to them in return. Just beyond
the college we passed an old town surrounded by ancient
towers and time-worn walls.</p>

<p>"This ancient stronghold," said the guide, "was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
known as the Citadel of Europe. The fortress commanded
the Strait and enabled the Sultans of four centuries
ago to levy toll on all passing vessels. At this
place, where the Bosporus is only about half a mile wide,
the Persian ruler, Darius, with his army crossed on a
bridge of boats to invade Greece. Here also the
Crusaders crossed on their way to free the Holy Land
from the clutch of the Saracens."</p>

<span class="caption">LEVIED TOLL ON ALL PASSING VESSELS.</span>
</div>

<p>The Moltke sailed into the Black Sea merely far enough
to sweep around in a wide circle and then, returning
through the Bosporus, passed by Constantinople and
entered the Sea of Marmora.</p>

<p>"It seems like parting with a dear old friend," said a
tourist as we looked back on the fading domes and
waved farewell to mosque and minaret. "We have seen
so much of the city in so short a time. Every hour has
been used to the best advantage in the Turkish capital."</p>

<p>Sunday, March first, was not to be a day of rest for the
tourists; for the Moltke had arrived at Smyrna at daylight
and was to remain in the harbor of that city only
until dark.</p>

<p>The principal reason for a day's stay at Smyrna was to
give an opportunity for an excursion by train to the site
of ancient Ephesus. Many of the tourists took this trip
to see the few scattered ruins that mark the place where
once stood the magnificent Temple of Diana. The
clergymen of the party desired to view the place where
the Apostle Paul had fought in the arena with wild
beasts, and where Demetrius and his fellow silversmiths
had led the rioters against this Apostle whose preaching
interfered with the sales of silver shrines for Diana.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>Other tourists, who did not take the excursion to
Ephesus, explored the narrow, badly-paved streets of
Smyrna, and visited the bazaars. This city would have
seemed more interesting to us but for our previous
visit to the more picturesque Constantinople. In a
crowded street we encountered a flock of turkeys driven
by a native. The turkeys appeared to understand the
driver's commands and were more easily guided by a
touch of his long switch than would be a flock of
sheep passing through a street in an American city.</p>

<p>Setting sail again, we passed late in the evening the
island of Patmos, where Saint John wrote the book
of Revelations, and on Monday morning we saw at a
distance the island of Rhodes, noted for its historic
defense by the Knights of Malta. About nine o'clock
Tuesday morning the Moltke anchored in the Bay of
St. George some distance from the shore. On the
surrounding hill slopes rose the city of Beyrout. Fresh-looking
white and yellow tinted buildings, red-tiled
roofs, and a background of green groves and orchards
interspersed with white villas, gave the city an appearance
of newness. The whole scene, with the snow-capped
Mountains of Lebanon beyond, presented a
beautiful picture to the eye.</p>

<p>"Beyrout has a population of 120,000, and is a prosperous,
growing city," said one of the managers of the
tour. "It is a centre of missionary work, and has
American and German colleges. The old streets are
narrow, as are all old streets in Eastern towns; but
they are clean. The newer streets are of modern width.
Educational advantages, foreign enterprise, and Euro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>pean
mercantile firms have infused new life into the
native population."</p>

<p>Madame Barakat, a native of Syria, and a well-known
lecturer and Bible reader, had very kindly given us
letters of introduction to her Syrian relatives in Beyrout.
Among these were Mr. Sarkis, a highly respected gentleman
who had been honored by the Sultan with decorations
for services to his country, and who was also an
author and editor of a daily newspaper; and Mr. Sabra,
his assistant, a tall, fine-looking man. Another was the
Rev. Mr. Zurub, pastor of the Congregational Church.
The three gentlemen were able to converse in English
as fluently as in their own tongue.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>We were very cordially received by Mr. Sarkis, and,
after meeting and conversing with the other gentlemen,
were shown through their printing house, where Syrian
type-setters were setting type to print Arabic letters
that looked like shorthand characters, and Jewish girls
were employed binding pamphlets. Our names were
given to the printer, and in a few minutes he presented
us with visiting cards containing the names in Arabic
letters, thus:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/illus193.jpg" width="200" height="57" alt="Arabic script" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Let us visit a candy factory while waiting for the
carriages I have ordered," said Mr. Sabra. "I know
that the ladies are fond of sweetmeats and I can guarantee
these to be perfectly pure. We think that our
candies are delicious," he added as we entered the
factory, and the ladies agreed with him after eating some
of the sweets.</p>

<p>The Syrians take pride in their city, in its factories,
its hospitals, its seminaries and colleges, its progressive
business spirit, and the beauty of its suburbs. We
visited one of the silk factories where hundreds of
Syrian girls were engaged in unwinding the cocoons of
delicate gossamer that had been tediously spun and
wound by the silk worms among the leaves of the mulberry
trees in the great orchards on the hillsides.</p>

<p>"On the slope of yonder mountain we have a villa in
which we spend the hot summer months," said Mr.
Sabra, pointing to the distant mountains as we reached
an elevation from which a broad view was obtained.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
"If there had been time I would have taken you there to
see one of the most beautiful views in Syria."</p>

<span class="caption">CACTI IN BEYROUT MADE AN IMPENETRABLE FENCE.</span>
</div>

<p>"The landscape is magnificent as seen from here,"
we replied. The fruitful valley lay before us, beyond
rose the verdant hills, and above all towered the stately
mountains of Lebanon. Villages, hamlets, villas, exuberant
gardens, orchards of spreading mulberry trees,
graceful palms, fig, lemon, and orange trees enhanced
the beauty of the scene.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>"Our colleges and schools," said Mr. Sarkis, "are
equal to those of a European city. Our people are
becoming an educated people; almost all of the younger
generation can read and write. My daughters have been
educated in the American Seminary and can converse
fluently in French, German, and English, as well as in
Arabic."</p>

<p>In a narrow thoroughfare we passed horses laden
with long boards strapped lengthwise on their backs,
and camels laden with huge timbers strapped to their
backs and sides in the same manner.</p>

<p>"This is my home," said Mr. Sarkis, as the carriage
stopped before a large house surrounded by a small
garden and a high wall. "I wish you to meet my wife
and sister and daughters."</p>

<p>Our hostesses were dressed in the English fashion, and
our hosts, too, wore modern English clothes, but the
red fez on their heads designated them as Turkish
subjects. When we expressed an interest in their way
of living, the ladies took us from the reception room,
which was furnished in modern style, into their garden
where orange and lemon trees and semi-tropical plants
were growing. They conducted us then through the
spacious marble-floored central hall, permitting us to
look into nursery and bedrooms fitted up partly in
modern and partly in Oriental style, and led us up a stone
stairway to the level roof, which, with its surrounding
parapet, recalled the one described in "Ben Hur."
Here fruit was served by a Syrian maid clad in the
native costume. On our return to the lower floor, our
hostesses conducted us to the divan salon or Oriental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
smoking room. There, while we rested on low couches,
the Syrian maid passed around Turkish coffee in dainty
cups, and then brought a lighted narghileh from which,
in turn, each one present took a few whiffs of the mild
Turkish tobacco.</p>

<p>Mr. Sarkis told us that he had visited the United
States at the time of the Chicago Exposition. He took
one hundred and forty Arabian horses to the Exposition
and had some interesting experiences while there.
The Rev. Mr. Zurub had spent sixteen months in
America and spoke in the highest terms of the kindness
with which he had been received by the American
people.</p>

<p>In the evening a ball was given on the deck of the
steamer, which had been tastefully decorated for the
occasion. Our friends, Mr. Sarkis, Mrs. Sarkis and
sister, the daughters, Fahima, aged about eighteen, Neda,
aged about fourteen, and a son, aged about sixteen,
together with Mr. Sabra, came on board to visit the
ship. Mr. Sabra sang some Arabic songs and Fahima
joined him in a duet.</p>

<p>About fifty tourists left the Moltke at Beyrout in
order to take the side trip of three days to Damascus,
the oldest city in history, and to the ruins of the great
Temple of Baal at Baalbek. A narrow-gauge railway
extends across the Lebanon Mountains from Beyrout
to Damascus. The distance is but ninety miles, but
as the train has to rise to an elevation of nearly five
thousand feet and then descend to the valley beyond,
the average speed does not exceed ten or twelve miles
an hour. On Wednesday morning the steamer stopped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
at the little seaport of Haifa just long enough to send
ashore sixty passengers. Some of these wished to take
the side trip to Nazareth and the Sea of Galilee by carriage;
the others, to make the excursion through the
interior of Palestine on horseback, camping on the way,
and rejoining the main party in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>At noon on Wednesday the Moltke anchored in the
unprotected harbor of Jaffa over a mile from the shore,
as it is not safe for a large steamer to approach nearer.
This was the landing place in the Mediterranean most
dreaded by the tourists; for we had heard of jagged
rocks that projected their black heads from the water,
and of rough seas that on windy days broke over the
rocks making the passage from the vessel to the dock
very dangerous. The weather, however, was fair and
the sea unusually smooth that noon as the tourists one
by one dropped from the platform at the foot of the
stairway into the row-boats as they rose on the swell
of the waves. The boats were large and built expressly
for this dangerous harbor. Each boat was managed
by eight men, six rowers, a helmsman, and a bowman,
and each boat carried about twenty passengers. As the
Syrians labored hard at the oars they chanted continually
a prayer to Allah for a fair passage.</p>

<p>After safely landing at the stone steps of the dock,
we proceeded through the streets to the special train
which was waiting to carry us up to Jerusalem, not
stopping to visit the traditional house of Simon, the
tanner, where the Apostle Peter had a vision on the
roof.</p>

<p>"The oranges of Jaffa are noted as being the finest in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
the world. Don't fail to buy some," said a gentleman
from California. "We raise good oranges in my state,
but ours are not quite equal to those of Jaffa."</p>

<p>Arab men and boys surrounded the tourists at the
station offering carefully packed baskets, each containing
two or three dozen fresh, juicy oranges at what
seemed an extremely low price. When the train started

<p>The journey from Jaffa to Jerusalem was literally
"up;" for the Sacred City is nearly three thousand feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
above the sea, and four hours was required for the trip of
fifty-four miles. After leaving Jaffa the train passed
through a succession of interesting panoramic views:
gardens where richness of soil was manifested by the
rankness of the growth of the plants and flowers; groups
of palm trees with long, rough trunks, and tufted heads
high in the air; long rows of tall, narrow-leaved, evergreen
eucalyptus trees; orchards of orange trees where
yellow fruit clustered amid the glossy dark green leaves;
orchards of almond trees covered with a delicate pink
bloom; and orchards of gray olive trees with a carpet
of grass underneath, as beautiful as a park; bare fig
trees whose time for leaf and bloom had not yet come;
and fences of huge leaved prickly cactus plants protecting
garden plots.</p>

<p>"What queer looking plows they have," said a companion,
as we noticed near the train a plowman who
had stopped his camel, and thrown his plow, which
looked like a crooked root with a point, out of the furrow,
while he gazed at the passing train. "The first gardener
must have obtained a plow of the same kind from the
original forest."</p>

<p>In stretches of sod the rich brown earth was being
turned up by farmers with teams of camels, one great
camel to each little wooden plow, or with teams composed
of an ox and an ass hitched together. In one field twelve
camel teams were plowing the sod. We use the word
field, but there were no fences except the cactus hedges
around small plots. The farm boundaries from ancient
times have been marked by corner stones to which
Moses referred when he gave the law: "Cursed be he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
that removeth his neighbor's landmark." We were in
the midst of historic places mentioned in the Bible. To
the north lay the fertile level fields of the Plain of Sharon.
Fields of young wheat were beautified by the roses of
Sharon,&mdash;red poppies with black centres and short
stems,&mdash;which dotted the carpet of green with flecks of
red. At Lydda, where Peter healed the man who had
the palsy, Arab urchins begged the passengers to buy
little bunches of the red poppies and other wild flowers
that they offered for sale. To the south stretched the
Plain of Philistia, the scene of Samson's adventures,
and the fields through which he sent the three hundred
foxes with firebrands tied to their tails. In that direction
also lay battle fields where Philistines and Israelites
struggled for supremacy.</p>

<p>The towns and villages on the route were small and
mean. The better buildings were constructed of stone
with flat stone roofs, but many were made of mud with
mud roofs on which a crop of grass was growing. After
the first hour's ride, fertile rolling plains succeeded the
level sandy loam. When about thirty miles from
Jaffa, after a two hours' ride, the hill country of Judea
was entered. From that point the train traveled slowly
and laboriously up the hills and mountains by steep
gradients. Overhead in the limestone cliffs were many
caves, one of which was pointed out as Samson's Grotto.
Whenever there was any soil among the rocks and stones,
the grass grew luxuriantly, making good pasture for the
herds of nimble-footed black goats that picked their
way along the steep and rocky mountain side. The
red rose of Sharon grew in profusion and took possession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
of the uncultivated ground around the trees and between
the rocks. At many places the abundance of these
poppies and the beauty of their groupings gave to the
land the appearance of a park planned and laid out by
a landscape gardener. Nearer the summit the hills
were bleak and barren. Here was the village of Bittir,
a group of little stone houses clinging to the mountain
side, where terraces supported by stone walls held up
small gardens on which cauliflower and other vegetables
were growing.</p>

<p>"For the past hour," said a lady who had been intently
gazing out of the window of the car, "yes, for a longer
time, I have been looking forward expecting to see a
city burst forth impressively into sight, a city upon a
mountain top, 'beautiful for situation.' Now the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
conductor tells us that we are nearing our destination,
and yet cliffs and hills are all that we can see. Where
is Jerusalem? 'A city set upon a hill cannot be hid.'"</p>

<p>"You have not read your Bible closely," replied a
minister in our compartment. "David said, 'The mountains
are round about Jerusalem,' As it was then so
we shall find it now, on hills surrounded by other hills.
Do not expect to see the city of Solomon's time which
the Queen of Sheba came to visit. Its glory departed
eighteen centuries ago. I fear that your imagination
has led you to expect more than the modern Turkish
town which we shall find, and you may feel like lamenting
with Jeremiah, 'Is this the city that men call the
perfection of beauty, the joy of the whole earth?'"</p>

<p>It was not until we were approaching the railway
station, which is situated in the suburbs about a mile
from the city, that we obtained a view of the yellow
walls and buildings of the Holy City, and the sight then
was not impressive, as we had expected. Then at the
station, amid the noisy cries of many Arab drivers, we
obtained seats in carriages, and were driven at breakneck
speed over a good road down into the valley of
Hinnom and up a long hill to the Jaffa gate.</p>

<p>The party had been divided by the managers into
sections for the various hotels, and each tourist had been
given a card with the name of his hotel. Those who
were to go to hotels outside the walls of the city proceeded
directly to their destination in carriages. Those
who were to stay within the walls descended from the
conveyances in front of the Grand Hotel just within the
Jaffa gate, and went the rest of the way on foot through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
narrow streets that carriages could not enter. The
writer was assigned to the Casa Nova, or Hospitium
Franciscanum, a monastery or hospital built expressly
for the accommodation of pilgrims to the Holy City, and
controlled and managed by Franciscan monks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">JERUSALEM.</p>


<p>On Wednesday evening, after our arrival at
Jerusalem, we visited a small store to purchase a
guide-book of the city. But the merchant would
not accept our French or English money, and we had no
Turkish money. We laid the book down, but the dealer
said, "You take the book and pay me another time."</p>

<p>"Are you willing to trust a stranger?" we inquired.</p>

<p>"Yes!" he replied, "I trust American any time.
You may buy goods, all you want, three hundred dollars'
worth. I trust you. When you go home to America,
then you send me the money."</p>

<p>"Were you never cheated?" we asked.</p>

<p>"No," he answered, "I trust American many time.
American always pay, but me not trust Frenchman;
Frenchman forget."</p>

<p>Glad to know that our countrymen bear such a good
reputation, we took the book without giving our names,
merely telling him that we were staying at the Casa
Nova and would pay the next day.</p>

<p>In our country we can travel from Maine to California
with one kind of money. All that is necessary is to
have plenty of it. But in these foreign lands the currency
changes as we move from one country to another,
so that we may have a pocket full of money and yet
not be able to pay our bills. At Funchal, Portuguese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
money was current; at Gibraltar and at Malta, English
money; at Granada, Spanish; at Algiers, French; at
Athens, Greek; at Constantinople and Jerusalem, Turkish.
In Cairo another coinage was current, and in
Italy the Turkish and Egyptian coins left over had to be
sold to the money changers or taken home as souvenirs.
In large cities the hotels and larger stores accepted
American, English, and French money at its value, but
small dealers and individuals knew nothing of foreign
coins and wanted payment in their own currency.
As it was desirable at all times to have plenty of small
coins on hand, the tourists soon became acquainted
with the value of shillings and pence, francs and centimes,
drachmæ and lepta, piasters and paras. On
our arrival at each port the managers of the tour and the
purser of the vessel obtained a large number of small
coins of that particular country so that the needs of the
tourists could be promptly supplied.</p>

<p>Our room at the Hospice was rather cold but my
room-mate said there was one compensation, we need
have no fear of the hotel's burning down and so need
not be anxious as to the location of the fire escapes
before retiring. The Casa Nova is a stone building
with stone stairways and floors. In our room there was
nothing inflammable but the mosquito nettings and lace
draperies over the iron bedsteads. Two candles furnished
us with light, hempen rugs covered portions of
the black and white marble floor, a gilded crucifix hung
on the painted stone wall, and two chairs, a small table,
and a washstand completed the furnishing.</p>

<p>Early Thursday morning, with bright anticipations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
we started for a visit to Bethlehem. The drive of six
miles over a good limestone road was one of much
interest. Our dragoman pointed out the well where the
wise men, stooping to drink, saw the reflection of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
star in the water before they beheld the star itself in the
sky.</p>

<p>"Why, how could that be?" inquired one of the party.
"I thought the wise men were following the star."</p>

<p>But the guide did not attempt to explain. It was his
business to state facts in which he had believed all his
life; not to enter into disputes with unbelievers as to the
truth of his statements. He showed us a great rock in
the road where Elijah, wearied in his flight, lay down
to rest. It seemed to be a hard bed for a tired man, but
we remembered that in olden times rocks and caves
were selected for sleeping-places and stones often served
for pillows.</p>

<p>Camels were so numerous on the road that they lost
their novelty,&mdash;camels single and camels in trains, with
great hampers swinging at their sides laden with sacks
of lime or charcoal, with building stone or cauliflower,
with fish or flagstones, with chunks of wood and gnarled
roots, with bags of grain and crates of vegetables, each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
camel carrying a quantity about equal to a one-horse
wagon load. From a hill-top we caught a glimpse of the
Dead Sea lying far below us in the valley twenty miles
away. We met women on their way to market with
heavy baskets of cauliflower and other vegetables
poised on their heads, men bending under distended
goat-skins filled with water or wine strapped to their
shoulders, donkeys bearing basket-panniers filled with
produce or laden with bags of grain heaped on their
backs, Greek priests in black robes and high hats carrying
white umbrellas for protection from the sun, and
turbaned Arabs in brown robes plodding along with
staves in their hands.</p>

<p>The mountainous suburbs of the city are composed
of limestone, and the limestone rocks cropped out on
every side. The rocks protruding from the soil were of
a light gray color, but the broken rocks, the fences, and
the houses built of stone had changed to a light yellow
shade from exposure to the weather. The fields were
covered with stones except where little patches had been
cleared with great labor and the stones built into fences
surrounding the small plots. The hill-sides were almost
bare of soil. Where the stones had been cleared away,
the soil of decomposed limestone produced a luxuriant
growth. The cauliflower carried to market was the
finest we had ever seen. The few scattered olive trees
in the valleys appeared strong and healthy in their
light green foliage. The fig trees were bare, but occasional
groups of almond trees were covered with pink
bloom.</p>

<p>During our drive we saw peasants plowing little plots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
with single donkeys and crooked wooden plows, or
digging between rocks and around grape vines with
clumsy, heavy-looking hoes. The grape vines were
trimmed back to within three or four feet of the ground
and were not supported or trellised. Women gathered
the trimmings of the vines, bound them into fagots,
placed the fagots on their heads, and carried them away
to the city for firewood. Not a sprig was wasted. The
old roots that were dug out of the ground were borne
away in the same manner. In a country without forests
and without coal everything that will burn is utilized.
We saw girls carrying flat baskets on their heads and
the guide satisfied our curiosity by explaining that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
baskets contained dried cakes of camels' dung which
the girls had gathered and were taking home for fuel.</p>

<p>Rachel's tomb, situated four miles from Jerusalem,
and about two miles from Bethlehem, recalled to memory
the old love story: "And Jacob served Laban seven
years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few
days, for the love he had for her."</p>

<span class="caption">THE PEOPLE OF BETHLEHEM WERE BRIGHT AND CHEERFUL.</span>
</div>

<p>Cut in the rock, near Bethlehem is an ancient well,
known as the well of David. From that point we obtained
a good view of the square stone houses of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
little town of Bethlehem, which is built on a sloping
hill-side, and of the great spreading Church of the
Nativity, which is the dominating feature of the place.
Beyond the city we saw a verdant plain, where possibly
Ruth gleaned, and, farther away, the hills where probably
David led his flock to "green pastures" and the
shepherds of later days received the "tidings of great
joy."</p>

<p>In the narrow streets of Bethlehem our driver shouted
to men, women, and children to clear the way and make
room for the carriages to pass through, snapping his
whip at them if they did not quickly obey. When we
arrived at the old Church of the Holy Nativity we were
told that this venerable place is in reality a group of
buildings, the original edifice having been built fifteen
or more centuries ago, and many additions having been
made in after years. We saw a structure of yellowish
stone walls pierced with small windows which appeared
to us more like a prison or a fortress than a place of
worship. There were no stained glass windows. There
was no imposing portal opening into the temple. On
entering the sacred enclosure we passed through a door
in the stone wall so low that we were compelled to stoop
and so narrow that but one at a time might enter.</p>

<p>"This doorway," said the guide, "should remind the
pilgrims that the birthplace of the Savior is to be
visited with humility and reverence."</p>

<p>In the large, time-worn interior of the church, faded
mosaics, huge columns, and stone floors presented a
rather gloomy aspect. The tourists hastened through
and descended to the crypt or vault underneath the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
church. This vault was paved with marble, and on a
raised platform in the centre was a large, handsomely
decorated altar. Suspended from the ceiling were many
ancient lamps of curious make and smaller lamps hanging
in festoons. On one side was a small room, called
the Chapel of the Nativity, where thirty gold and silver
lamps threw a dim, soft light on the scene below. In
the pavement before an altar was a star of silver, and
the words:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Hic de Virgine Maria Jesus Christus natus est."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Opposite and near the Chapel of the Nativity was
another small, rock-walled room called the Chapel of the
Manger. In this room the dim light of golden lamps
revealed a white marble manger in which a large wax
doll reclined.</p>

<p>"The original wooden manger or cradle in which the
infant Jesus reposed was taken to Rome," explained the
guide. "If you return by way of Rome you may see it
in the great church of Santa Maria Maggiore."</p>

<p>"The care of the chapels, shrines, and holy places of
the Church of the Nativity," he continued, "is appointed
to the Latin, Greek, and Armenian churches. The
space inside the building is divided. Each sect has its
own particular portion to care for, and an intense
jealousy exists among the rival religious bodies. If
the rug of the Armenian is accidentally pushed over the
Latin line, the action is resented. If the broom of the
Latin while cleansing intrudes upon the Greek domain,
there is trouble. Disputes have arisen from very
slight causes, blows have been exchanged, rioting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
blood-shed, and murder have followed. Priests at
times have fought with priests until the Turkish soldiers
intervened. Now, by the Sultan's orders, Moslem
guards are stationed in the church to restrain the impetuous
caretakers and prevent disturbances."</p>

<span class="caption">THIS ROUND-TOPPED RIDGE IS CALLED THE MOUNT OF OLIVES.</span>

<p>In one of the underground chapels of the church, a
dark and gloomy cavern cut out of the solid rock, the
guide said: "In this grotto Saint Jerome passed thirty
years fasting, praying, meditating, and writing. His
last communion was taken here."</p>

<p>We remembered that Domenichino's celebrated painting
in the Vatican at Rome, called the "Last Communion
of St. Jerome," represented the aged saint dying amid
luxurious surroundings.</p>

<p>When we came out of the church, bright-faced boys
and girls urged us to buy their wares or accompany them
to the shops. The little town appeared to prosper from
the manufacture and sale of souvenirs of carved mother-of-pearl
and olive-wood. Crosses, crucifixes, rosaries,
beads, glove-boxes, writing desks, inkstands, napkin
rings, paper knives, and forks were offered as genuine
wood from the olive trees of David's town, and the
mother-of-pearl mementoes were carved with minute
scenes of events in the life of Christ and of places in the
Holy Land.</p>

<p>After the purchase of olive wood souvenirs had been
made, the drive was continued to the Pools which Solomon
had built to collect water for use in the Temple.
These are situated among the hills about eight miles
from Jerusalem. The stone walls of the reservoirs
were so well constructed by Solomon's architects three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
thousand years ago that to-day the masonry is in
almost perfect condition. The Pools, we were informed
are not in use at the present time, although water is
conveyed in pipes to Jerusalem from springs near-by.</p>

<p>The glare of the sun on the white road and gray rocks,
the lack of green in the bare landscape, and the fine
dust from the limestone caused a slight smarting in the
eyes of the travelers. So it was with relief that in the
suburbs of the city, about half a mile from the Damascus
gate, we descended a long flight of stone steps into the
shade of an excavation in the rocks about twenty feet
in depth. This open chamber, known as the Tombs of
the Kings, is about ninety feet square. At one side is a
doorway in the rock four feet high and thirty inches
wide, and beside the doorway stood a huge stone,
rounded at the corners, that might, by the united efforts
of several men, be rolled in front of the entrance so as to
close it completely. We crawled through the hole in the
rock and entered a cavern. The candles of the guides
revealed on each side of the cavern small rooms or caves
containing shelves or apertures which had been used
as the sepulchres of the Kings.</p>

<p>Jerusalem, situated on four hills, is surrounded by
hills which are separated from the city and from each
other by deep valleys or gulleys. We drove from
Jerusalem to the Mount of Olives over a well constructed
modern limestone road that wound among these hills
and valleys in long curves and horseshoes in order to
reach a place that seemed almost within a stone's
throw.</p>

<p>"The summit of this round-topped ridge, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
called the Mount of Olives, is owned by Russia,"
explained the guide, "and the Russians have erected an
observation tower, a chapel, and other buildings upon
it. These buildings are surrounded by a courtyard
enclosed within high stone walls, and a fee must be paid
at the gate in order to gain admittance. Within the
court a small circular pavilion covers the place from
which, it is claimed, the ascension of the Savior was
made."</p>

<p>As we approached the gate, a group of Russian men
and women were seen coming sadly away. We were
informed later that these peasants, after tramping a long
distance on a holy pilgrimage in order to kneel down and
kiss the stone that marked the sacred spot of the Ascension
of their Lord, were refused admittance because
they had not the required fee to pay for entrance. In
a Roman Catholic church, built on the spot on Olivet
where Christ is said to have taught His disciples to pray,
the Lord's Prayer is displayed on charts in large letters
in thirty-six different languages, so that pilgrims from
all parts of the world can read the prayer in their own
tongue.</p>

<p>From the summit of Olivet, which is two hundred
feet above the city of Jerusalem, we looked down over the
Holy City; but a finer panoramic view of the surrounding
country was obtained afterwards from the Russian
observation tower. The climbing of the two hundred
stone steps which lead to the top of the tower was not
easy, but we felt amply repaid by the magnificence of
the view. Near the foot of the mountain lay the Garden
of Gethsemane. Beyond and four hundred feet below<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
us, the little brook Kedron trickled through the narrow
Valley of Jehoshaphat. Across the valley on the opposite
heights of Mount Moriah, only half a mile away
in a direct line, prominent in the foreground, stood the
Mosque of Omar, and back of it rose the square roof
and round domes of the city buildings. Away off to the
east, deep down in the valley, we could see a portion of
the Dead Sea and could trace the Valley of the River
Jordan.</p>

<span class="caption">AND A FEW LEAVES FROM ONE OF THE ANCIENT OLIVE TREES.</span>
</div>

<p>We walked from the summit of the Mount of Olives
down a steep, rocky, crooked, narrow lane, hemmed
in by stone walls, to the foot of the slope, as it is considered
too dangerous for the tourists to remain in the
carriages while descending this short cut to a lower road.
The carriages rejoined us later. At the foot of the hill
there was a piece of land about half an acre in extent
enclosed by a white stone fence. Within the enclosure
was a garden surrounded by an iron fence. Between
the stone fence and the iron railing was a wide path.
Within the garden were eight gnarled olive trees that
appeared to be of great age, and flower beds which were
carefully tended and guarded by Franciscan monks.
It was not necessary for the guide to tell us that this was
the Garden of Gethsemane. Small shrines with pictures
above them, fourteen in all, representing the fourteen
traditionary stations of the Via Dolorosa, were
arranged at intervals along the path around the garden.
Before these shrines pilgrims were kneeling in prayer.
As we were leaving the garden an old monk with tonsured
head, in long brown robe girt about with a hempen
cord and having sandals laced on his bare feet, presented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
each, of us with a flower from the garden and a few leaves
from one of the ancient olive trees.</p>

<p>The Tomb and Chapel of the Virgin, which is but a
short distance from Gethsemane, had a venerable
aspect, and the olive trees surrounding it were patriarchal
in appearance. We crossed the sunken court and
descended a broad staircase of sixty steps to a gloomy
chapel which seemed to have been excavated in the
rock.</p>

<p>"These tombs on the right are the tombs of the parents
of the Virgin, Joachim and Anna," said the guide as we
halted in the dim light. "That tomb on the left is the
tomb of Joseph, the husband of Mary. The small
chapel at the end of the grotto contains the empty tomb
of the risen virgin."</p>

<p>On the road to Bethany we passed many trains of
pack mules, twenty or thirty in a train, and caravans
of camels striding along in single file. A light rope or
chain connected the leading camel with the others and
kept them from straggling.</p>

<p>The Arab who drove our carriage told us that he was a
scholar. He explained by stating that he could converse
fluently in four languages, besides his own native
Arabic tongue. These languages were Turkish, Russian,
Latin, and French, and in addition, he knew enough
English to give some information to the tourists. The
linguistic ignorance of the occupants of his carriage
seemed to impress him with the idea that education in
America is neglected.</p>

<p>Bethany, barely two miles distant from Jerusalem, is
a poor little village with steep, rough, dirty lanes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
a number of old and dilapidated small stone houses
amid broken walls of other houses which evidently have
been equally insignificant. One of these piles was
pointed out by the Bethany guides as the ruins of the
home of Mary and Martha, and we were then taken to a
narrow lane where a dark and slimy stairway led down
to the reputed tomb of Lazarus. Our dragoman, who
firmly believed in the traditions of the country, said that
he could not vouch for the statements made by the
Bethany local guides.</p>

<p>Returning to Jerusalem, we visited the so-called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
palace of Caiaphas, the High Priest. This palace is an
excavated ruin. Steps lead down to the marble floor,
which is fifteen or twenty feet below the present level
of the street.</p>

<p>"The circle on the pavement," said the custodian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
"marks the place where Peter stood with the soldiers,
warming his hands by the little fire which they had
kindled in a brazier, when he was accused by the maid
of being a companion and follower of the Prisoner then
on trial before the High Priest. The stone pillar that
you see in the courtyard of the palace is the stone on
which the cock was perched when its crowing quickened
Peter's memory, softened his heart, and brought bitter
tears to his eyes."</p>

<p>After leaving the palace we followed the guide through
a rough narrow street to a view point on the wall. Far
below us lay the Valley of Jehoshaphat, the village of
Siloam, and the site of the pool to which Jesus sent the
blind man to wash.</p>

<p>"The walk to the pool through the rough and crooked
streets would be difficult now for a man with good sight,"
remarked one of the tourists, "how much more so would
it be to a blind man groping his way."</p>

<p>Permission to visit the Temple Area, or Haram, as it
is called by the Moslems, had been obtained from the
Turkish authorities by the payment of heavy fees. We
proceeded to that place on foot accompanied by the
dragoman. At the gate of the Area the authorities
furnished Moslem guides to conduct the visitors through
the enclosure, and sent Turkish soldiers to accompany
the party to restrain any possible irreverent or unseemly
conduct while within the holy precincts.</p>

<span class="caption">II. THE AREA EXTENDS OVER THIRTY-FIVE ACRES.</span>
</div>

<p>"The Temple Area, which probably covers the place
where was once the Court of the Temple," explained the
dragoman, as we halted within the grounds, "is thirty-five
acres in extent, about one thousand feet wide by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
two thousand feet in length, and is surrounded by high
walls. It is revered by the Moslems as one of their most
holy places. This is the Mount Moriah hallowed by the
sacrifices of Abraham, glorified by the prayers of King
David, consecrated by the Temple of Solomon, and
made additionally sacred by the ascension of the Prophet
of Allah. The Moslems forbid the entrance of Jews into
the Haram, although the Jews have as great reverence
for the place as the Moslems."</p>

<p>In the centre of the Area, on a raised embankment or
platform, paved with marble slabs, stood a handsome
octagonal building covered below the window line with
marbles of various hues and above that line by decorated
tiles of blue-and-white porcelain edged with green. As
we stood on the marble pavement and gazed at the tiling
mellowed by age, and at the round lead-covered dome
above, the guide continued his explanations.</p>

<p>"This edifice, called by the Moslems the Dome of the
Rock," said he, "but better known as the Mosque of
Omar, is built on the site of the Temple of Herod, and
also on the site of the Temple of Solomon, which preceded
that of Herod. Each side of the octagon is
sixty-six feet in length, and the top of the dome is one
hundred and fifteen feet above this platform."</p>

<p>Underneath a small pavilion at the entrance, attendants
laced slippers to our feet and then conducted us
into the Mosque. On the floor lay precious Oriental
rugs. Overhead in the dome, the light entered through
richly stained glass windows, tinting and beautifying
the interior and disclosing the mosaic decorations of the
ceiling and the Arabic inscriptions on the walls. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
one side was an exquisitely carved wooden pulpit inlaid
with ivory and mother-of-pearl. In the centre of the
Mosque a great rock, at least fifty feet long and almost
as wide, rose to the height of our heads. A beautifully
designed, gilded and bronzed iron railing prevented infidel
fingers from touching the rock.</p>

<span class="caption">WE WILL TAKE THE PICTURE AND INCLUDE THE TURKS IN IT.</span>
</div>

<p>"This mountain-top, the crown of Mount Moriah,"
said the Moslem dragoman, as we stood reverently before
it, "is the place where the arm of Abraham was stayed
as he lifted the knife to slay his son. This rock, in
David's time, was the threshing floor of Araunah, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
oxen trampled out the grain upon it until the time when
King David purchased the land and built here an altar
to the Lord. When King Solomon erected the temple
upon the site prepared and dedicated by his father David,
this Holy Rock became the altar upon which the priests
of the temple offered sacrifices. When Mohammed, the
Prophet of God, took his flight to Heaven he rose from
this sanctified place, which is nearer to Heaven than any
other spot on earth, leaving as a memorial the impression
of his foot which you now see there in the rock. The
print of the hand in the rock near the footprint was made
by the angel Gabriel when he prevented the rock from
following the Prophet in his ascent."</p>

<p>At the foot of the flight of steps which the tourists
descended on their way from the marble platform of the
Dome of the Rock to the Mosque of El Aksa, the tourists
encountered Turkish photographers, who, hoping that
the Americans would gladly make use of their services,
had been patiently awaiting their arrival. But the
tourists were well supplied with their own outfits, and
these amateurs, disdaining the offered professional
services, secured snapshots themselves.</p>

<p>"What!" said one of the amateurs indignantly, "let
the Turks take us? No! let some of the party stay
on the steps and we will take the picture and include
the Turks in it."</p>

<p>While returning through the extensive grounds of the
Haram, one of the tourists lighted a pipe. Immediately
a Moslem guard approached and with unintelligible
words, made it known by his frowning face and
threatening gestures, that the pipe must be extinguished.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<p class="center">THE CHURCH OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE.</p>


<p>The floor of the vast Church of the Holy Sepulchre
is below the level of Christian Street. We
descended to the church through a narrow alley
about a hundred feet in length, which by slopes and steps
led downward. On each side of this alley peddlers had
stands for the sale of beads, rosaries, crucifixes, candles,
and souvenirs, which they earnestly besought the visitors
to buy. The church is so surrounded by other buildings
that it could not be seen until we arrived at the foot
of the alley, where a few steps to the left led down to a
wide stone paved court. Even then only the rough
stone facade and the top of the dome were visible.
The door was guarded by Turkish soldiers, but they
did not object to our entrance.</p>

<p>Within the Church, in the centre of the vestibule, we
paused beside a marble slab six feet in length, elevated
slightly above the stone floor. A canopy overspread
the marble and at the sides of the canopy stood six
immense ornamented silver candlesticks rising higher
than our heads. In these were tall candles.</p>

<p>"This is the Stone of Unction," said the guide. "On
this marble the body of Jesus lay while it was anointed
for burial. Two of these candlesticks belong to the
Greek Church, two to the Armenian Church, and two
to the Latin Church. In this holy edifice each religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
sect claims the privilege of taking part in the worship
and in the care of the sacred places."</p>

<p>Not far from the vestibule the guide halted, and
pointing to a circle on the stone floor, said: "This
circle marks the place where the Mother of Jesus stood
at the time of the anointing."</p>

<p>The Church of the Holy Sepulchre, we ascertained, is
composed of many parts. A rotunda, sixty-six feet
in diameter, occupies the center. Above this rises the
dome, supported by eighteen large piers. On one side
of this round room, an opening leads into a Greek
church; on the other side, entrances between the piers
lead into small chapels. Grouped around outside of
these, but connected with the central rotunda, church,
and small chapels, are other chapels, rooms, and sacred
places, the whole covering a space of over two acres.
In the centre of the rotunda, directly underneath the
dome, stands a small marble building twenty-six feet
long by eighteen feet broad, richly decorated with
carvings, inscriptions, and figures of angels. At one
end of this building there is a small door guarded by
huge bronze candlesticks ten feet in height and over-hung
with gold and silver lamps of curious oriental
design. Three golden crosses surmount the front of
this miniature building: one of Greek form furnished
by the Greek Church; one of Roman form, by the
Latins; and one of the Syrian shape, by the Armenians.</p>

<p>"This small building," said the guide, "encloses the
place of the Sepulchre. The interior is divided into
two parts. The first you will enter is the Chapel of the
Angel. The Tomb of the Savior is in the second part."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">A CRUST IN HER HAND, A GRIN ON HER FACE.</span>
</div>

<p>Passing between the lines of huge candlesticks and
underneath the clusters of overhanging lamps, we
entered the small doorway and were in the Chapel of the
Angel. In the centre of this small room stands the
stone upon which, the guide said, the angel sat after
rolling it away from the entrance to the Savior's
tomb. Stooping
low we passed
singly through the
narrow opening to
the tomb. This is
a small chamber
about six feet
square, the floor
and walls of which
are covered with
white marble. At
the right hand
side of the tomb
a marble slab
about two feet
wide extends the
length of the chamber.
This marble
is much worn by
the millions of kisses that have been tearfully and
reverently pressed upon it by the pilgrims of many
centuries. Two score of golden lamps, continually
burning overhead, shed a soft but brilliant light upon
the tomb. Our visit to the interior of the tomb was
short; for not more than five persons may stand in it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
at one time, and other pilgrims from other lands were
waiting their turn to enter.</p>

<p>For a small fee the local guides provided us with
tapers, for some of the chapels and grottoes within
the vast cluster of the buildings of the church were dark,
and in the gloomy recesses the holy places could not
be seen without a light. In the dark grotto of the
Syrian chapel our tapers shed a dim light on two tombs,
which the guide said were those of Nicodemus and Joseph
of Arimathea.</p>

<span class="caption">WE WALKED THROUGH THE NARROW VIA DOLOROSA.
</span>
</div>
<p>"This is the Chapel of the Apparition," explained
the guide, after leading us to another part of the church.
"Here the Lord appeared to Mary, His mother, after the
Resurrection. In a niche beside the high altar is a hole
in the wall. If you hold your taper up to it you may
see within the wall a part of the column to which the
Savior was bound during the Flagellation. You may
touch the sacred column with this round stick, provided
for the purpose, if you wish to do so. The stick, being
worn smooth by the numberless kisses that have been
pressed upon it by the pilgrims after touching the holy
column, can do it no harm."</p>

<p>In a vestibule outside the chapel a star in the marble
floor marks the place where Christ appeared to Mary
Magdalene after the Resurrection, and a second star
a few feet beyond marks the spot where Mary stood
when she recognized the risen Lord.</p>

<p>We passed from the rotunda into the Church of the
Crusaders or Greek Church, through a wide opening
directly opposite the door of the Holy Sepulchre. In
this large chapel the walls and ceilings, the seats of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
choir, the high altar, and the seat of the Patriarch in
the rear of the altar, are composed of precious woods
beautifully carved and ornamented with gold and silver
and jewels. Hundreds of superb golden and silver
lamps, varying in form and design, hang suspended
from the ceiling at various heights. In the centre of
the chapel, standing in the middle of a fancifully designed
circle on the checkered marble floor, is an urn containing
a marble ball.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">

<span class="caption">THE VERY STONES HIS SACRED FEET HAVE PRESSED.</span>
</div>

<p>"This ball marks the centre of the world," explained
the guide, as we halted beside the urn. "About eight
centuries ago certain wise and holy men ascertained,
by calculation or by inspiration, that this spot is the
exact centre of the world. It was marked in this
manner so that the pilgrims coming here from all parts
of the earth might see it and carry the knowledge of the
wonderful discovery back with them to their various
countries."</p>

<p>Beyond the Greek Chapel we descended, by aid of
our burning tapers, a flight of thirty stone steps to the
ancient, dimly-lit Chapel of St. Helena.</p>

<p>"When the Empress Helena was inspired to search
for the true cross," said the guide, "she employed
workmen to excavate here. There is the seat on which
she sat while superintending the search, and there below
us is the excavation in which she found the three crosses,
the crown of thorns, the nails, and the inscription."</p>

<p>We peered into the darkness below but could see only
a gloomy hole about eight feet deep and twenty feet
across, a short flight of steps cut in the rock, and an
altar at one side.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">THE OLD STREET OF SORROW LIES BURIED TWENTY FEET BELOW.</span>
</div>

<p>Reascending to the main floor, we halted at the
Chapel of the Mocking. There the guide showed us the
stone upon which the Jews made Jesus sit while they
crowned Him with thorns. The guide then led the way
up a flight of steps to the Chapel of Golgotha, which is
within the great structure of the church but upon the
summit of a rock fifteen feet higher than the main floor.
At one side of this chapel, where the rock itself projects
slightly above the floor, a figure of the Christ in dying
agony is suspended upon the cross, and at the foot of the
cross stand the figures of Mary, His mother, and St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
John, both dejected and sorrowful. These figures
appear to be made of gold and silver. The crowns
on their heads are covered with diamonds, rubies,
emeralds, and other precious stones. A hole in the
rock surrounded by a gold plate marks the place where
the original cross stood. On the right and left are the
holes where stood the crosses of the thieves. A movable
gold plate covers the crevice in the rock caused by the
earthquake. In this chapel the pictures on the walls
are encircled with diamonds and other precious stones.
Adjoining this room is the Chapel of the Crucifixion,
where, as the guide informed us, Christ was nailed to the
cross, and close by is the place where the Virgin Mary
stood during the Crucifixion.</p>

<p>Descending a flight of steps to the main floor, we
entered a small cavern-like chamber.</p>

<p>"This," said the guide, "is the Tomb of Adam, and
the little chapel beyond is the Tomb of Melchizedek."</p>

<p>When one of the ladies, doubting the truth of these
traditions, excitedly began to remonstrate with the
guide, a clergyman in the party said to her: "It is
not worth while to enter into a dispute with the guide.
You cannot convince him that his assertions are incorrect.
Let us leave the topic for discussion in the evening
when we cannot go out sight-seeing."</p>

<p>We departed from the Church of the Sepulchre with
the intention of returning without a guide to inspect
portions of the building more leisurely. Preceded by
the guide, we walked through the narrow Via Dolorosa,
pausing a moment at each of the fourteen stations, which
mark the location of the historical and traditional events<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
that occurred in the street of sorrow. After the guide
had explained the route, one of the tourists devoutly
said: "Little did I think a year ago that I should walk
along the very path that has been stained by the blood
drops of the Savior on His way to the Cross, and tread
perhaps on the very stones that His sacred feet have
pressed."</p>

<span class="caption">AT THE ENTRANCE TO SOLOMON&#39;S QUARRIES.</span>
</div>

<p>A few minutes later we were admitted to a convent
on the Via Dolorosa. One of the gray-gowned nuns,
after exhibiting and offering for sale laces and embroideries
made by the sisters, led us to an excavation in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
the rear of the convent. There a courteous Abbess met
us, and said: "The excavation made here uncovered a
part of the original Via Dolorosa. The old way lies
buried twenty feet below the level of the modern street
known by that name, and at this place is one hundred
feet to the right of the one on which you were walking."</p>

<p>"You must bear in mind the history of Jerusalem,"
continued the Abbess in reply to our questions. "Forty
years after the Crucifixion Titus captured the city,
demolished the buildings, and slaughtered the inhabitants.
Jerusalem became 'heaps' and a 'desolation' as
predicted by the holy prophets. For a century thereafter
a village of huts built upon the ruins occupied the
site of the city; then the idolatrous Emperor Hadrian
rebuilt the city, laying out the streets to suit his pagan
ideas, and for two centuries it was a pagan city whose
people were devoted to the worship of strange gods and
regarded not the sacred places. Three hundred years
after the Ascension of our Savior, the blessed St.
Helena, mother of the Emperor Constantine, made a
pilgrimage from Constantinople to Jerusalem. Inspired
with holy zeal, she gave orders for the erection of
churches on the sites of the Nativity at Bethlehem and
the Ascension at Olivet. She prayerfully sought for the
sacred tomb in which the Lord had been laid, and her
efforts were rewarded by the finding of the true cross.
She cleared away the accumulated rubbish and built
the chapel on the holy ground, and that chapel has
grown into the great Church of the Holy Sepulchre.
Afterwards the locations of the events on the way to
the cross were marked on the modern street to corre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>spond
as nearly as possible to the places on the ancient
street which lay buried many feet below. The finding
of a part of the true Via Dolorosa in the excavation
within our enclosure has been a blessing to the convent."</p>

<span class="caption">WITH FACE TURNED TO THE WALL, KISSING IT AND MUTTERING PRAYERS.</span>
</div>

<p>The Abbess deserved and received more than spoken
thanks for her courtesy. We realized then the truth
of her last words.</p>

<p>During our walk we visited an old Armenian church,
which was gaudily decorated with red brocade hangings
and very antiquated paintings quaintly representing
scenes from Bible history. In the court-yard of the
church a young Armenian kindly offered us a pitcher
of water, which he said had been brought from a spring
outside the city for the use of the monks in the adjoining
convent. We received it most gratefully, for the drinking
water of Jerusalem is noted for impurity, and, as
we had been cautioned against it, we had abstained
from drinking water for three days.</p>

<p>"Will it be difficult for the tourists to find their way
through the narrow crooked streets of the city without
a guide?" inquired one of the ladies of the dragoman at
the noon hour.</p>

<p>"Oh no!" he replied. "Please open your map. I
notice you have one. You see that the city is divided
into four marked sections by the two principal streets
which cross each other at right angles: David street
extending from the Jaffa Gate at the west, through the
center of the city, to the Temple Area at the east; and
Damascus street extending from the Damascus Gate
on the north, through the center of the city, to the
Zion Gate on the south. The bazaars and little stores<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
that tourists visit are on these two streets, on Christian
street near the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and in the
vicinity of the Jaffa Gate. The Church of the Holy
Sepulchre is in the north-west section of the city, known
as the Christian Quarter; the Via Dolorosa passes
through the north-east section, called the Moslem
Quarter; the Temple Area is on the east side; the Wailing
Place of the Jews is near the south-west corner of the
Temple Area, in the south-east or Jewish Quarter; and
the Citadel is in the south-west of Armenian Quarter.
Jerusalem is not a large city. David Street is only half
a mile in length, and Damascus Street from the gate
on the north to the gate on the south is but three-fourths
of a mile long."</p>

<p>"This afternoon," said the guide at the noon hour
on Friday, "those of you who desire to do so may go
with me to the Wailing Place of the Jews. The Turkish
authorities do not permit Jews to enter the Temple
Area so the Jews, on Friday afternoons, congregate in
a narrow court, outside and adjoining the western wall
which encloses the Temple Area, to mourn over the
downfall of their beloved Zion and pray for the return
of Jewish dominion over the land of their fathers, and
for the renewal of the ancient glory of the City of
David."</p>

<p>When we arrived at the Wailing Place, we found about
a hundred Jewish men, women, and children assembled
in the court, with faces turned to the wall, the men at
one end of the court, the women at the other. Some
of the mourners pressed their faces against the wall,
kissing it and muttering prayers; some, as the guide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
explained to us, were reading the Talmud; some reciting
verses from the Lamentations of Jeremiah; and
some chanting the penitential Psalms of David.
Others we saw weeping, the tears running down their
faces, while one or two looked around with curious
gaze at the strangers.</p>

<span class="caption">PITIED THOSE MISERABLE LEPERS AT THE GATE.</span>
</div>

<p>Thence we returned through portions of the Mohammedan
and Jewish quarters of the city. The narrow
streets through which we passed,&mdash;if passage-ways ten
feet wide may be called streets,&mdash;are lined with little
stores. The stocks of provisions, groceries, bread,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
vegetables, and general merchandise for native consumption
are displayed in the open fronts of the
shallow store-rooms and the proprietors sit or stand
outside waiting for customers, like huge spiders waiting
for their prey, or with loud voices and many gesticulations
bargain with the buyers.</p>

<p>The streets of the Mohammedan Quarter are filthy;
those of the Jewish Quarter are worse.</p>

<p>"Are these alleys ever swept or cleaned?" inquired
one of the disgusted visitors.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" answered the guide, "the city, being
built on the hills, has a natural drainage. Whenever
there is a heavy rain the flowing water washes the
streets."</p>

<p>"Well," said the visitor, "the city of Constantinople
has the reputation of being the filthiest city in Europe,
but it has a brigade of canine street cleaners to assist
the rainfalls in cleaning the thoroughfares. If the city
of Jerusalem were in Europe, it could easily claim the
leading place in respect to filth; for dogs are few here
and heavy rains do not appear to be frequent."</p>

<p>The tramp through these quarters was not agreeable
to any of the senses. The ears were annoyed with the
jargon of many dialects; the harsh voices of the natives,
the loud exclamations of the dealers, and the whining
cries of the beggars for backsheesh. The eyes were
offended by the sight of the crowds of dirty beggars,
who stretched out hands in appeal and tried to clutch
the garments of the tourists with their dirty fingers,
until disgust drove away all feelings of pity. The odors
from the foul thoroughfares, from the messes of soft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
cheese and mixtures of eatables offered for sale, from
the discarded and decaying cauliflower leaves under
neath the stalls, from the pipes of Turkish tobacco,
and from the donkeys and unbathed human beings
with whom the tourists came in close contact, were inhaled
with loathing. The uneven, stone-cobbled paving
of the narrow streets without sidewalks, the steps up
and down the grades, and the slippery condition of the
muddy surface when wet caused weary feet.</p>

<p>"I will not give away another piaster," exclaimed
a lady whose purse had been drawn upon frequently
during our tramp. "I never met such disagreeable
beggars. There were many beggars in other cities, but
they did not whine and display their dirty rags so disgustingly
as these do. I pitied those miserable lepers
at the gate, but when I threw them some money they
crowded around and tried to touch me with their diseased
hands, instead of keeping at a distance and crying,
'Unclean! Unclean!"'</p>

<p>The beggars were the most objectionable feature of
the city; they persisted in following visitors and it was
almost impossible to drive them away. When rid of
one lot, others soon took their place. Repulsive cripples
insisted on calling attention to their deformities; sore-eyed
children clamored for assistance; and little tots
with dirty, fly-covered faces, shrilly prattled "Backsheesh."
The streets were full of these wretched creatures;
they congregated near the sacred places and there
the clamor was so annoying that the tourists had little
opportunity for contemplation until they were inside
the buildings and away from the beggars' entreaties.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p>We made several visits to the Church of the Holy
Sepulchre in order to observe the people; to view quietly
and leisurely the gorgeous decorations, especially those
in the Greek Chapel where each visit disclosed new
beauties; and to see the jewels, precious gems, and
pictures encircled in diamonds, in the Chapel of Golgotha.</p>

<p>During one of these visits we sat for awhile on a bench
by the wall of the church not far from the entrance to the
Sepulchre. It was interesting to note the diversity
of costumes and to watch the difference in the behavior
of the tourists and pilgrims of the various nationalities.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>"Notice that Russian group," said a companion as a
party of Russian pilgrims entered the church.</p>

<p>These people from the North, long-haired, heavy-bearded,
long-booted, heavy-coated men, and short-frocked,
heavy-shod women had come there, we could
plainly see, on a holy pilgrimage to the tomb of their
Savior, believing and trusting in the reality of everything
they saw. At the Stone of Unction they prostrated
themselves and kissed the stone slab, and as they
rose we could see the shaggy-bearded men wiping away
the tears with their rough hands. Then, with uncovered
heads, they slowly approached the entrance to the
Sepulchre, bowed down, crossed themselves, knelt
inside, and after kissing the marble tomb, backed out,
bowing and crossing themselves until well away from
the tomb.</p>

<p>"The people of other nationalities outwardly show
more reverence for the sacred places than do those of
our own country," commented my companion. "The
guards have just censured that group of Americans on
the other side of the room. I could not hear what was
said, but the actions of the guards spoke louder than
words, and I noticed that the loud talking ceased at
once."</p>

<p>The party of Americans came laughing and chatting
toward the Sepulchre and entered the tomb without any
appearance of reverence in their manner,&mdash;a striking
contrast to the devout Russian pilgrims. Other Americans,
however, following, entered the tomb silently,
and came out with a look of awe upon their faces.
One of these told us that he had placed some postal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
cards and letters on the tomb to be blessed by contact
with it before mailing them to his friends. Another
had taken some bunches of flowers and laid them on the
tomb for the same purpose before pressing them for
souvenirs. A party of Germans stood near us for
awhile, apparently arguing in low tones over some statement
of the guide, and then quietly and with uncovered
heads advanced and entered the Sepulchre. Some
Italians knelt for a long time before the door, and
Africans, Greeks, and natives of countries unknown
to us, bowed or crossed their foreheads or breasts before
the entrance. No other nationality, however, showed
such zeal and intensity of feeling as did the Russian
peasants.</p>

<p>On Saturday afternoon we visited the Church of the
Holy Sepulchre to be present at the special service held
on that day. We found that the number of guards at
the door had been doubled, and that companies of
armed Turkish soldiers had been stationed within to
preserve order in the assembled throng of sight-seers and
worshipers and to keep a passage-way open through
which the expected processions might pass. Pushing
our way through the crowd we obtained a good position
behind some Syrian women and children who, attired
in gala costumes, held unlighted candles in their hands.
At the Place of Sepulchre the oriental lamps above the
door and the candles in the huge candlesticks had been
lighted for the special service, brilliantly illuminating
the marble front of that small building and bringing
into clear relief every detail of the carved ornamentation.
In the Greek Chapel the golden lamps and the candles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
at the altar were burning, and the chapel was ablaze
with reflected glory.</p>

<p>"They are coming," whispered some one as the
tramping of feet on the stone floor was heard.</p>

<p>A procession of Greek priests in gorgeous garments,
swinging censers of smoking incense and bearing aloft
a golden cross, marched to the Sepulchre, made obeisance
there, then proceeded slowly around the building several
times and entered the Greek Chapel where a short
service was held. After the Greeks had left the building,
a procession of Armenian priests appeared clad in black
silk robes and peculiar looking black silk hoods draped
over their heads. They were led by a venerable Patriarch
arrayed in a magnificent embroidered robe. The
Patriarch knelt and kissed the Stone of Unction, then
the procession marched singing to the Sepulchre, which
they entered, two priests at a time. After this part
of the ceremony was concluded the priests marched
singing three times around the room, while a bell in
the gallery merrily clanged an accompaniment. When
the Armenians had withdrawn, a procession of Roman
Catholics entered singing. The chanting was accompanied
softly by an organ in an adjoining chapel. The
censer bearers waved their smoking bowls until the
whole place was fragrant with the odor of the incense.
Tonsured monks with sandaled feet, in gowns of brown,
girt with hempen cord; censer bearers, cross bearers,
brazier bearers, and choir boys in white embroidered
surplices and skirts of scarlet; priests in black; bishops
in purple; and higher dignitaries in capes of fur and
long-trained robes,&mdash;all these marched round and round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
bearing lighted candles and chanting the ritual to the
strains of the organ, and then proceeded toward the
Latin Chapel. Our Syrian neighbor and her children
lighted their candles and joined other worshipers with
candles in the rear of this procession, and we followed
to the Chapel where all knelt for service.</p>

<p>Palestine appeared to us to be a land where history
and tradition were so curiously mixed that it was difficult
to know where history ended and tradition began. During
our tramps around the city of Jerusalem and its
vicinity the guides pointed out the spring where the
Virgin Mary washed the clothes of the infant Jesus in the
same way that we saw other women in the East washing
clothes on the banks of public streams; the hill of evil
counsel where the avaricious disciple had been tempted
by gold to betray his Master, and the field where the
horror-stricken traitor ended his life; the place just
without the Gate of St. Stephen where the sainted
Stephen knelt and prayed for his persecutors until the
stones cast by the infuriated Jews crushed out his life;
the spot where the Apostle James was beheaded,
commemorated by the church of St. James which now
stands on that location; the large room outside the Zion
Gate in which the Lord washed the disciples' feet and
partook of the Last Supper; the tomb of the wayward,
long-haired Absalom, and the mausoleum that covers
the resting-place of his father, King David; the footprint
of Jesus in the rock and the hole made by His
staff on the Mount of Olives; the imprints of the
Savior's feet in the rocky floor made during the time
of the scourging; the site of the house in which the
Virgin lived with the disciple John after the Crucifixion.</p>

<p>Palestine was noted in olden times as a land flowing
with milk and honey. At the Casa Nova we drank
of the milk, the milk of the black-haired goats that fed
along the hillsides, and ate of the honey, which was of
delicious flavor. The Syrian waiters who served our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
meals and also cared for our bedrooms were picturesquely
dressed in long gowns of blue striped material falling
to their ankles, and encircled with bright sashes, and
these men at all times, whether making beds or serving
tables, wore on their heads the red fez of Turkish subjects.
The managers of the Hospice, the Franciscan
monks, wore the garb in which the monks of that order
are always seen, brown gown, rope girdle, rosary with
pendant cross, and sandals.</p>

<p>On Sunday a cold rain fell during the day, making it
unpleasant for sight-seeing and confining the travelers
to the house during most of the day.</p>

<p>"How disappointing this is to be kept in the house by
the rain," exclaimed a discontented tourist while
watching the rain drops glide down the window-pane.</p>

<p>"Have you thought," said another who was busily
engaged with guide-book and pencil, "that until to-day
not one unpleasant day has interfered with our trip?
The temperature has been neither uncomfortably warm
nor disagreeably cold, but just delightful for the exertion
of sight-seeing."</p>

<p>The tourists having made a request for some heat in
the house, one of the gowned Arab servants carried a
brazier into the reception room, placed a handful of
charcoal in it and lighted a fire. As we gathered around
the little fire trying to warm our hands, one could
realize the scene many centuries ago, in the Palace of
Caiaphas, when the soldiers coming in at midnight from
the cold hills, kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and
Peter, shivering from cold and fear, joined the group
around the brazier to warm himself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have been trying for the past three days," remarked
an elderly clergyman, "to realize that these
bare hills were once 'a land flowing with milk and honey,'
producing 'grapes, pomegranates, and figs' in abundance.
To-day I have been thinking of the changes that the
tempests of a few short years have made in the hills of my
own native state, New Hampshire, since the rapacious
lumber-men have been denuding our mountains of the
forests. There, the unprotected soil is being washed
away by the heavy rains, gulleys have been formed, the
brooks have diminished or dried up, and the part of our
once beautiful White Mountains that has been cut over
is desolate indeed. Now, since thinking of the changes
that have occurred in a decade at home. I can more
fully realize the changes that centuries have made here.</p>

<p>"Looking backward," said he, "I can see more
clearly in my mind the picture that David saw with
the eye of an artist, and described with the heart of a
poet, when these bare, gray, rocky, treeless hills were
crowned with forests that protected the soil from the
beating storms; when these slopes, now furrowed with
gulleys and spread with stones, were covered with
orchards and clad with verdure, where the flocks might
'lie down midst pastures of tender grass;' and when
these dried up waterways were purling brooks, where the
flocks were 'led beside the waters of quietness.' I
believe that David's description of this country was a
true picture of the land as it appeared then. 'Thou
waterest the ridges thereof abundantly; thou settlest
the furrows thereof; thou makest it soft with showers;
thou blessest the springing thereof. The pastures are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
clothed with flocks; the valleys also are covered over
with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing.'"</p>

<p>"In those days the vicinity of Jerusalem was beautiful
with palm trees," continued the clergyman, "and the
City of Palms was but fifteen miles away. Now the
City of Palms is a squalid, unhealthful village, and in the
vicinity of Jerusalem it is difficult to obtain a leaf of the
palm."</p>

<p>The low spirits caused by the drizzling rain during
our last evening in the Sacred City were increased by
telegraphic news received from Jaffa. The telegram
stated that the weather was stormy and the waves running
high, and that if the sea did not subside we might
not be able to embark. This information caused considerable
anxiety among the timid members of the party
and many surmises were made as to the developments
of the following day. As usual, all the arrangements
for our departure had been carefully made in advance
by our managers. We were notified that the Syrian
bell boys would waken us at five o'clock, and our baggage
must be ready at five-thirty; breakfast would be
served at six o'clock; the carriages would be at the
Jaffa Gate at six-thirty; and the train would leave the
Jerusalem station at seven.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">CAIRO AND THE PYRAMIDS.</p>


<p>On Monday morning, after enjoying our usual
breakfast at the Casa Nova of boiled eggs,
rolls and pure honey, good coffee, and delicious
oranges, we bade farewell to our tonsured hosts and the
staff of gowned attendants. The carriages were waiting
near the Jaffa Gate to convey us to the station. The
train moved off promptly at the appointed hour, and
looking backward, we took our farewell glimpse of the
Tower of David and the yellow walls of the Holy City.</p>

<p>During the three hours' ride to Jaffa the threatening
clouds passed away, the sun re-appeared, the rough
winds changed to soft breezes, and our depressed spirits
rose correspondingly. By the time the orange groves
in the suburbs of Jaffa came into sight, the tourists
were in a gay and cheerful humor. But when we arrived
at the pier of Jaffa, we discovered that the sea
still felt the effects of the gale. The surf was rolling
high and the angry waves were breaking violently over
the ugly-looking rocks in the harbor, hiding them for
an instant from view and sending the snowy spray high
into the air. As we looked out toward the Moltke riding
at anchor a mile away, many of the gay faces became
sober. The boatmen holding the tossing boats to the
pier urged us to embark.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"But timorous mortals start and shrink to cross the narrow sea,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And linger trembling on the brink and fear to launch away"</span><br />
</p>

<p>"Oh, I cannot venture! Go without me! Leave me
behind!" exclaimed one of the ladies, trembling and
almost fainting through fear. "Those black rocks
momentarily emerging and disappearing seem like the
heads of terrible monsters waiting to devour us as soon
as we come within their reach."</p>

<p>"Do not be alarmed," said one of the officials on the
pier, encouragingly. "The sea, as you say, has a
threatening look, but I assure you that if there were any
danger we would not permit you to attempt the passage.
These Syrian boatmen have been carrying passengers
for years and know every rock in the harbor. They
brought the Damascus tourists from the Moltke without
mishap this morning when the sea was rougher than now.
Trust the boatmen and you will soon be safely on board
the steamer."</p>

<p>As our boat in its passage over the stormy billows
plunged downward into the trough of the sea, and
horizon, ship, and land were hidden from view, we
thought that the uplifted, on-coming crests of the waves
would engulf the boat beneath them; but, expertly
handled by the trained rowers, the craft rose with each
immense surge and safely passed the breakers. The
Syrian boatmen, who had been continually chanting
their hymns to Allah while plying their oars, suddenly
stopped singing.</p>

<p>"Bachsheesh! Backsheesh!" they cried, ceasing to
row, while one of them, doffing his fez, passed it around
the boat for contributions. The passengers, grateful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
for safety, dropped their coins into the fez; again the
oars were put in motion, the chant was resumed, and in
a few minutes the boats were alongside the vessel.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<span class="caption">SHE WAS WASHING CLOTHES IN THE CANAL.</span>
</div>

<p>Then came the difficulty of getting on board the
steamer; for the little boat lay underneath the platform
at the foot of the ship's ladder, tossed by the billows.
As each heaving swell, however, bore the boat upward,
two sturdy seamen on the platform, reaching down,
grasped a passenger's arms and drew him up while the
boatmen assisted from underneath. In this way, one
with each wave, the tourists safely embarked. The
passage from the pier to the steamer affected the tourists
in various ways: many were frightened, notwithstanding
the assertion of the official that the dangers were more
apparent than real; others were exhilarated by the
tossing waves and enjoyed the thrilling experience.</p>

<p>"I was so interested in watching the muscular development
of the boatmen as they pulled at the oars, and in admiring
the dexterity and skill with which they managed
the boat, that I did not think of danger," remarked
a man who had been stroke oar on a college crew.</p>

<p>While the tourists were being transferred to the ship,
the band on deck was playing "Home, Sweet Home,"
and the Captain and other officers standing at the head
of the stairway gave a friendly greeting to the wanderers
as they came on board.</p>

<p>"It is pleasant to be welcomed back in this friendly
manner," remarked one of the ramblers to another
as they entered their cabin, "and then it is so homelike
here in our stateroom, with our photographs and nick-nacks
pinned around the walls."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<p>A busy afternoon of re-packing followed the departure
from Jaffa, for on the following day the tourists were
to leave the steamer at Alexandria to remain twelve
days in Egypt. Clothing that was considered suitable
for the climate of that warmer region was carefully
selected and condensed into the smaller receptacles,
and every article that the tourists supposed would not
be required was left in the staterooms.</p>

<p>On Tuesday morning, March tenth, at seven o'clock,
the Moltke was anchored in the commodious port of
Alexandria, which is enclosed by long stone breakwaters
that have been built into the sea to protect the harbor.
Many vessels were at the docks or at anchor in the port,
and a handsome white yacht flying the imperial flag of
Germany lay within a stone's throw of our steamer.</p>

<p>"The Crown Prince of the German Empire is visiting
Egypt and that is his yacht," said one of the officers.</p>

<p>The morning was bright and clear. It was a delight
to breathe the warm salt air and feel its invigoration.
Overhead the sky was brilliantly blue and the sea reflected
it in various hues.</p>

<p>"Did you ever see such wonderful coloring on the
waters of sea or river?" asked an enthusiastic beholder.
"Near by the sea sparkles in the morning sunlight in
azure and olive and darkens into sapphire and emerald,
and there beyond the breakwater it changes to tints of
violet and purple. I have heard that the colors of the
Mediterranean are beautiful; now I know they are."</p>

<p>The row boats that were to carry us ashore gathered
around the steamer. The bare-footed boatmen, with
faces of various shades from light yellow to intense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
black, were attired in red fez, white bloomers, and long
red sweaters.</p>

<p>At the custom house on the dock the custom officials
accepted the statement of the managers that the baggage
of the tourists contained nothing dutiable, and the
baggage was passed without examination. A special
train was on the pier ready to convey the party to
Cairo. Beggars and peddlers attempted to approach
the train to ask alms or sell their wares, but were driven
away with whips by black Nubian soldiers in dark blue
uniforms, who appeared to take delight in snapping at
the bare legs of the intruders.</p>

<p>It was just noon when our train, the second special
section, moved out of Alexandria through long rows of
large warehouses; for Alexandria is the chief seaport
of Egypt and exports the cotton, grain, sugar, rice, and
other productions of the valley of the Nile. As the
train passed rapidly southward through the delta of the
Nile, we realized that we were in a land entirely different
from any that we had previously visited. The trip
of one hundred and thirty miles to Cairo will be remembered
by the tourists as a panoramic succession of
interesting pictures of agricultural life. The land on
both sides of the railway was a black, sandy loam, level
almost as a floor, intersected and broken only by the
canals and irrigation ditches. For some distance out
of Alexandria the Mahmudiyeh canal was in sight.</p>

<p>"There is a scene that is familiar to me!" exclaimed
one of the party. "A landscape hanging in the art
gallery of our city represents the light blue water of a
canal mirroring tufted palms and wing-like sails. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
was painted by a noted artist, who has successfully
reproduced many beautiful Egyptian views."</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;WANT A GUIDE? WANT A GUIDE?&quot; THEY INQUIRED.</span>
</div>

<p>Nile boats with breeze-filled canvas, caravans of
camels on the embankment of the canal, and trains
of donkeys laden with marketing for the city by the sea,
seemed stationary as we rushed by. The land appeared
to be thoroughly cultivated. There were no fences or
waste corners in sight. Every foot of workable ground
was utilized for raising crops.</p>

<p>"Irrigation makes this almost rainless region the
most fruitful on the globe," remarked one of the managers
of the tour. "By the aid of irrigation the Egyptian
farmers can raise two or three crops every year.
To do so, however, they must labor incessantly and
give the land thorough cultivation. Irrigation with
them is not opening the gates of a sluiceway and letting
the water flow over the land. It means severe labor,
pumping the water up from the ditches, canals, or
river, in which the surface of the water may be ten or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
twenty feet below the surface of the land. The pumps
are the same kind that the people used in the days of
the Pharaohs, and the methods of cultivation are the
same as in those ancient times, without modern agricultural
implements or modern machinery. Three crops,
therefore, does not mean great prosperity, but simply
enables the Egyptian farmer to pay taxes that would
seem enormous to an American farmer, and then to have
a surplus sufficient to supply his very moderate wants."</p>

<p>The monotony of the level stretches was varied by
groups of palm trees whose tall rough trunks upheld
graceful heads of outstretched, drooping leaves, and by
villages of small mud huts roofed with stalks of sugar-cane,
sufficient, we imagined, in that dry country, to
protect the inmates from the burning noonday heat,
and to shelter them from the chilling night dews. Occasionally
the train stopped at large and apparently
prosperous towns, where there were substantial stone
buildings and busy factories. At these stations Arab
venders offered coffee, lemonade, fruit, and other refreshments
to appease the hunger and thirst of the
travelers.</p>

<p>The fields were full of life. Each cultivated acre had
its dark-hued laborers with hoes, or bare-legged toilers
drawing water from the ditches for irrigating the
thirsty land, or plowmen guiding teams of ungainly,
striding camels or dark gray, crooked-horned oxen.
In the lush meadows many of these curious-looking
animals were grazing. The camels, the small donkeys,
and the gray oxen or water-buffaloes as the natives called
them, tied to stakes, were restricted to the pasturage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
within reach of their tethers. Along some of the irrigating
canals naked dark-skinned men and boys splashed
about in the water, or stood unabashed on the bank of
the stream, gazing at the passing train.</p>

<p>"Look at that scene," cried one of the passengers.
"I wonder whether our cattle at home would not enjoy
similar treatment."</p>

<p>In the canal some naked boys were mounted on a
buffalo, and near them an Arab, also in the water, was
scrubbing the back of another buffalo, to the evident
enjoyment of that animal.</p>

<p>As we approached Cairo, the great valley of the delta
narrowed, and mountain boundaries loomed up in the
distance. Far away to the right the tops of the Pyramids,
looking very small, silhouetted the sky. On the
left, high hills broke the landscape, and presently the
buildings and minarets that crowned the hills were
outlined on the horizon. Handsome villas, beautiful
gardens, good roads, and increasing traffic in the suburbs
indicated the nearness of a prosperous city.</p>

<p>Just four hours after leaving Alexandria our train
entered the station at Cairo, where hotel-runners, cab-men,
and porters gave the passengers a noisy reception.
Complete arrangements having been made in advance
for our party, we had time to take in the novel sights
leisurely. The party had been divided into two sections;
one section booked for the famous Shepheard's
Hotel, the other section for the Hotel Grand Continental.
The avenues through which we were driven on the way
to the Hotel were bordered with large shade trees.
The streets were full of life. The buildings were modern,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
seemingly of French style, with a mixture of Oriental
architecture.</p>

<p>"What a contrast," said one, thinking aloud of the
city we had left but two days ago, as our carriage glided
smoothly over the well paved highways. "Did two
cities ever present a stronger contrast than Jerusalem,
with streets narrow, rough, filthy, and depressing to the
spirits, and Cairo, with avenues broad, smooth, clean,
and pleasing to the senses? The interest in the city
of Jerusalem had to be stirred by the memorials of the
sacred events of the past; the discomforts of the present
had to be overlooked. The city of Cairo appeals to us
at once as a pleasure ground with attractions on all
sides, and the promise of comfortable surroundings."</p>

<p>The hotels of Cairo are famous throughout the world
for the magnificence of their appointments, the cosmopolitan
character of their guests, and the novelty of the
sights that may be seen at their doors. When we drove
up to the Hotel Grand Continental, a military band was
giving an afternoon concert in the beautiful Esbekieh
Gardens opposite the hotel. On the wide pavement in
front of the piazza of the hotel, dragomen in elaborate
Arabic costumes were offering their services as guides
or interpreters. "Want a guide? want a guide?" they
inquired of all strangers who they thought might need
such service. Arab urchins, whose hands may have
once been clean, offered picture postal cards for sale;
bootblacks solicited patronage and beggars asked for
alms; match peddlers endeavored to dispose of their
little boxes; flower sellers thrust their bouquets forward
into notice; dealers in scarabs and miniature mummy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
cases proclaimed the virtues of their charms; and
venders of beads offered endless varieties of their fanciful,
colored Egyptian wares. Interest in the scene was
heightened by the variety of the characteristic flowing
gowns peculiar to the natives of Egypt. On the piazza,
groups of guests were taking afternoon tea, and listening
to the music in the park opposite, or, seated comfortably
in wicker chairs, found amusement in watching the animated
throng on the sidewalk; in observing the arrivals
and departures on donkeys and in victorias; and in viewing
the constant panoramic procession on the street.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>

<p>The head porter, in gorgeous uniform, received us with
the air of a proprietor; Arab bell boys in bright red silk
gowns responded to the call of the manager and conducted
us to our rooms; and Arab men in white gowns
brought up our luggage. There were French maids on
each floor to attend to the calls of the ladies; but Arab
men in spotless robes made the beds, cared for the
rooms, and took the place of chambermaids. These
Arab men were seated in the wide halls when not
employed at their tasks, but whenever a guest approached
they rose and stood at attention, appearing very tall
in their white drapery. In the dining room the English
head waiters in dress suits contrasted strangely with
the dark-skinned Arab waiters in handsome silk gowns
of various colors.</p>

<p>On the evening we arrived in Cairo the large gardens
of Shepheard's Hotel were beautifully illuminated with
thousands of electric lights and hundreds of Chinese
lanterns festooned among the shrubbery. Two military
bands alternately played selections from favorite composers
during the evening. An exhibition of fire-works
made a brilliant display, and this was followed by a
"battle of confetti" in the garden and a dance in the
hotel. Our party bought packages of paper confetti
and joined the gay crowd of merrymakers in casting
handfuls of the colored squares of paper at each passer-by.
At the dance the great variety of handsome uniforms
worn by the English officers attracted our attention,
the red jackets of some of the men being particularly
noticeable among the light gowns of the French and
English women.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

carefully made, so that during our one week in Cairo
we might give precedence to the places of particular
interest, and see them at the most suitable hours.</p>

<p>When we visited the Egyptian Museum, the wealth
of antiquities displayed within its commodious and well-lighted
halls held us with a grasp from which it was
difficult to break loose. The mummies of the old kings
who had been dead for thirty centuries urged us to
remain. "We will tell you the story of remote ages,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
they seemed to say. There Ramses II, with gray hair,
thin beard, and pierced ears, the great conqueror, builder
of temples, erector of statues, and maker of history,
lay peacefully at rest. His lips were firmly closed, his
hands folded across his breast. His high forehead
indicated the judgment with which he governed, and
the strong nose suggested the greatness of his power.
And near him, in hieroglyphic-covered coffins, reposed
Seti I, constructor of magnificent edifices; Ramses III,
oppressor of the Israelites; and many other famous kings,
queens, priests, and warriors. The wooden statue of a
village sheik with good-natured face and crystal eyes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
and the tinted limestone, lifelike statues of Prince
Rahotep and his wife Nofret, could they have spoken,
might have revealed the secrets of ages long before the
times of the mummies; and the gray stone figure of
Chepren, which was found in the well of the temple of
Gizeh, might have explained the mysteries of pyramid
and sphinx.</p>

<p>From the parapet of the citadel which crowns the
heights above Cairo, we gazed at the extended view of
roofs, mosques, minarets, and tombs of caliphs, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
listened to the story of the massacre of the Mamelukes
and the legend of the one who marvelously escaped by
leaping on his horse over the parapet to the ground
sixty feet below. To convince us of the truth of this
legend, the dragoman showed the impression of the
horse's hoofs in the stone coping on the wall. The
large Mosque of Mehemet Ali, on the heights, is built
of pure alabaster and carpeted with costly rugs. The
older Mosque of Sultan Ahmed, at the foot of the citadel
hill, is built of sandstone taken from the Pyramids, and,
although partly in ruins and with bare stone floors, it is
yet beautiful.</p>

<p>"This mosque make Ahmed glad. He not want
another built like it, so he chop hand off architect,"
explained our good-natured dragoman, whose control
of English was limited, but he endeavored to relate the
legends and give information.</p>

<p>While returning from the citadel we came by an open-air
market, where Egyptians of many types were gathered
in groups around piles of merchandise and vegetables.
Here our camera man, taking advantage of an opportune
moment, caught a dense mass of faces before the natives
became aware of his presence.</p>

<p>On Friday afternoon we visited the Monastery El
Akbar to see the religious exercises of the Twirling
Dervishes, which take place there every Friday afternoon.
The shrill music, the fanatic faces, the obeisance
to the leader, the whirling men, the naked feet, and the
never-touching skirts, just as we beheld them, are
pictured vividly by Canon Rawnsley, in his "Idylls
and Lyrics of the Nile."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>We drove from Cairo to the Pyramids of Gizeh, a
distance of ten miles, over a substantial macadamized
avenue. This broad highway, elevated eight or ten
feet above the adjoining lands in order to protect it
from the flood of water during the time of inundation,
was bordered for seven miles with large shade trees, and
was in perfect condition. On one side of the avenue
an electric tramway extended from the bridge at Cairo
to the Mena House Hotel near the Pyramids.</p>

<p>"We might have reached our destination more quickly
in the cars," said our manager as an electric car sped
by us, "but at such speed we should have missed much
that is strange and curious. We thought it preferable
to take the trip in open carriages."</p>

<p>The scenes along the way as we drove to the Pyramids
were indeed novel. In the gardens in the environs of
the city, the cabbage, onions, beans, and strawberries
were in readiness for the market, and in the fields, the
clover and forage plants, dark in color and luxuriant in
growth, were ready for the sickle, but the wheat was
yet green. The fellahs&mdash;the Egyptian farm-laborers&mdash;were
cutting the rank clover in square patches and
stacking it on the backs of camels or donkeys. Along
the road stalked camels beneath huge stacks of fragrant
clover, and donkeys so laden with newly-cut forage
that only their heads and feet could be seen. A crooked-horned
ox with an Arab farmer on his back ambled by.
A caravan of camels laden with blankets, tents, and
military supplies, accompanied by a guard of white-helmeted
English soldiers, almost blocked the road
as they marched past. Bronzed-faced natives seated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
in the shade dealt in sugar-cane stalks, cutting pieces
of cane from the pile of stalks beside them as they were
sold. Turbaned Arabs sauntered by, chewing with
evident enjoyment the sweet stalks which they had
purchased. Bedouins from the desert rode past on
camels bedecked with tasseled trappings, swaying back
and forth as they rode. Women, partly veiled, coming
from the wells, balanced on their heads large earthen
bottles filled with water.</p>

<p>"There are many pyramids," said the guide, as our
carriage emerged from the shade of the trees and the
Pyramids were seen in the distance, "but Cheops is
the greatest, and it is the one that is ascended by
visitors; the other Pyramids are viewed at a distance
but are visited by few. Cheops is four hundred and
fifty feet in height and each side of the base measures
seven hundred and fifty feet. It was originally much
larger and higher but the outer layers of stone were torn
down and carried away to Cairo to build mosques and
palaces. The adjacent Pyramid of Chepren is almost
as large but as some of the steps are cased, it is more
difficult to ascend. When we arrive at the pyramids
you may take camels or donkeys and ride around the
base of Cheops. Or if you prefer to go on foot, you
may walk around it, but walking in the sand is tiresome.
Then we will proceed to the Sphinx and, after viewing it,
descend to the excavated temple near the Sphinx.
Afterwards, those who feel equal to the exertion may
climb to the summit of Cheops. As this Pyramid is
built of huge blocks of stone about three feet in thickness
each step upward requires some effort. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
Bedouins, however, will assist you in the ascent, two
of them mounting the step ahead and drawing you up
while a third pushes behind."</p>

<p>As we neared them, the Pyramids, which at first had
seemed small and hazy in the distance, became distinct
and grew in size. When very close to them they appeared
enormous, but their magnitude was not fully appreciated
until some hours later, after we had tramped through
the sand around the four sides of great Cheops. After
that walk, a distance of more than half a mile, we could
judge with greater exactness the immense proportions
of the extensive base. The slope of the sides prevented
a fair conception of their height when looking upward
at them; but after reaching the top of Cheops, panting
with the exertion of the laborious climb in which we had
been assisted by three Bedouins, we looked down at the
midgets moving on the sand below, and were convinced
that the altitude stated by the guide was not exaggerated.</p>

<p>The Pyramids of Gizeh stand upon a plateau about
four hundred acres in extent, which appeared to be
thirty or more feet above the level of the surrounding
country. The surface of this plateau is a barren sandy
tract, bordered by cultivated land on the side toward
the Nile and merging on the west into the Libyan desert
which stretches to the distant hills. Just as far as the
inundation of the Nile spreads or the irrigating water
was pumped, the land was fertile; where the surface rose
above the height reached by the water, the land was a
barren waste. Almost as suddenly as landing from an
emerald sea on to a desert shore, we stepped from a
rich growth of verdure to a bare slope of yellow sand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

<p>At the foot of the Pyramid of Cheops a gesticulating,
vociferous throng of Bedouins crowded about us, shouting
in Arabic mixed with a few intelligible English words.
Camel-drivers and donkey boys offered the services of
their animals to make
the circuit; helpers,
almost dragging us
away in their eagerness,
insisted that we
should climb to the
summit; and guides
with candles in their
hands importuned us
to accompany them
into the gloomy interior.
After a selection
of camels and
donkeys had been
made by those who
desired to ride, the
clamorous crowd of
natives separated, and
we were allowed to
start accompanied by
but a few, who followed
in case they
should be needed.
"Madam might drop
her shawl, or want her umbrella carried, or need an arm
to steady her in the saddle," explained the guide.</p>

<p>"For scores of centuries," remarked the professor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
as we stood before the Sphinx, "the strong winds from
the west have carried particles of sand from the desert
and deposited them around the Pyramids. Now the
original base of Cheops lies twenty or thirty feet beneath
banks of sand and debris that have collected
around it. In the same manner the encroaching
particles, drifting like the light dry snows of the prairies,
have almost engulfed the Sphinx. Many times in the
past the sand has been shoveled away to prevent the
Sphinx from being hidden from sight, and if this excavation
in which it now stands should be neglected for a
time, the desert winds would fill the pit again and
gradually cover the monument. The Granite Temple
adjacent to the Sphinx was covered over so completely
in the progress of centuries that its location was forgotten.
It is but fifty years since the French archæologist
Mariette discovered and excavated the interior
of this large structure, the exterior of which, as you see,
yet remains embedded in sand as far as the capstone
on the walls."</p>

<p>After descending the steps that led down to the floor
of the buried temple and passing through rooms constructed
of blocks of alabaster, we stood in the main
hall, surrounded by monolithic pillars of granite which
supported enormous blocks of the same material overhead.
The guide said that these huge blocks of granite
had been brought from quarries at Assuan, far up the
Nile, but he could not tell how the ancient Egyptians
had been able to handle the monoliths.</p>

<p>"My theory may not be correct," said the professor,
as we turned to him for a reply to the query<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
"but I will state it. We know how the great blocks
of limestone that were used in the erection of the
Pyramids were brought from the Libyan mountains;
for the father of history, Herodotus, relates the
story. He says that the Egyptians constructed a
solid road sixty feet wide of polished stone from the
quarry in the Lybian mountains and over this smooth
roadbed dragged or rolled the huge blocks. He also
states that as the work progressed, these blocks were
lifted by machines from step to step and imbedded in
their places in the pyramid. When granite or other
stone had to be brought from a great distance for the
erection of temples and palaces, as for this granite and
alabaster temple of the Sphinx, the Egyptians probably
adopted the simplest way of conveying the material
in a land where task-masters drove tens of thousands
of slaves to labor on the public works. That is, they
probably excavated canals from the Nile to the quarries,
supplementing these, where necessary, with stone roadways
or slides, and made other canals from the Nile to the
location selected for the buildings, and transported the
unwieldy masses of stone on barges to their destination."</p>

<p>"I made some calculations for comparison last night,"
continued the professor, seeing that we were interested
in his statements. "Professor Petrie, the archæologist,
says that there are over two million large blocks of
stone in the Pyramid of Cheops, or ninety-two million
cubic feet."</p>

<p>"Now, Professor," said one of the ladies, interrupting
him, "you are getting above our comprehension when
you soar into millions."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">BEARING ON HIS BACK AN UNWIELDY GOATSKIN.</span>
</div>

<p>"Am I?" he replied. "Well, I will leave the millions
and give you something more familiar. The Capitol
at Washington is seven hundred and fifty feet long,&mdash;just
the length of each side of the base of Cheops,&mdash;but
the Capitol is not half that in width. The Capitol
covers an area of three and one-half acres; the Pyramid
spreads over thirteen acres. The apex of the Pyramid
is one hundred and sixty feet higher than the head of
Freedom on the dome at Washington. The Capitol
is a hollow structure; the Pyramid, a solid mass, excepting
the comparatively small chamber of the tomb and
passage ways. The stone used in the construction of
Cheops would be sufficient to build the Capitol and the
Library of Congress, and there would be enough material<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
left over for capitol buildings in each of the states in
the Union. When you have time, calculate how many
miles of stone wall might be constructed with ninety-two
million cubic feet of stone. It is only by comparison
that we can comprehend the stupendous bulk of
these magnificent monuments, and realize the prodigious
amount of labor that was required for their erection."</p>

<p>It was but a short drive from the Hotel Grand Continental
to the Muski, the narrow street that is the centre
of the bazaar district, a district which every visitor is
sure to find soon after his arrival in Cairo. When we
entered the crowded Muski, we left the broad avenues
of the modern city behind and walked in narrow Oriental
streets through which carriages are not allowed to go.</p>

<p>"Everything is novel and interesting in this busy
thoroughfare," said one of our party. "I suggest that
we move along very slowly and stop frequently. See
that lemonade vender with the brass tank strapped to
his back. When he bent forward the water flowed
from the spout over his shoulder into the cup he held
in his hand, without his touching the tank. He is
waiting for his customer to produce the pennies that
apparently cannot be found."</p>

<p>The street scenes in the Muski were so kaleidoscopic
that it is impossible to give more than a suggestion of
their character. A few representative scenes can be
given and around these the imagination must picture a
constantly changing throng, not hurrying as in busy
American cities, but moving leisurely in the Eastern
manner. The crowd was orderly, but not quiet, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
tongues were in constant use. Merchants and customers
chattered and parleyed. Venders of licorice water
and sweetmeats did not permit their presence to be
overlooked, and donkeys occasionally joined in the
chorus. Each figure unfamiliar to our Western eyes,
in turban or in fez, in slippers or in bare feet, in scant
gown of cotton or full robe of silk, was a subject worthy
of being considered individually.</p>

<p>A baby, astride its mother's shoulder, clung to her
head while she walked along and made her purchases,
apparently unconscious of her child. A bare-footed
water carrier, bearing on his back an unwieldy goatskin
distended with its contents, cried, "Water for sale."
A donkey boy pushed aside the crowd to let the closely
veiled, silk-mantled lady rider pass through on her
caparisoned donkey. Muscular fellahs, or peasants,
in brown skull caps, and blue shirts which reached to
their ankles, their feet bare, their teeth remarkable
for whiteness, sauntered along chewing stalks of sugar-cane.
Women of the poorer class passed by, wearing
scanty gowns of plain blue cotton, heavy copper bracelets,
and nose ornaments of brass, which held in place
the veils that covered the lower part of their faces but
did not conceal the beauty spots tattooed on their foreheads.
A funeral procession, with professional mourners
chanting monotonously a hymn to Allah, followed a
casket borne on the shoulders of men. And these
curious scenes, which we tried to catch with the camera,
formed but unimportant parts in an ever-moving
picture in which were intermingled the costumes,
colors, and facial characteristics of dervishes, priests,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
and soldiers, of Arabs, Nubians, Turks, and Americans.</p>

<p>The Muski and the crooked little passage-ways that
intersected it were lined with small shops where many
of the dealers sat cross-legged on platforms within arm's
reach of their stock of goods. The stores for the sale of
each kind of goods had a special quarter of their own.
At one place we saw the shops of the coppersmiths with
stocks of bright kettles, pitchers, basins, trays, and
pans; at another, the stores of the shoemakers, where
hundreds of bright red slippers dangled on lines over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>head.
In one crooked alley, but four feet in width, we
watched the goldsmiths, squatted in narrow quarters,
busily at work with brazier and blowpipes and curious
little tools, hammering, twisting, and welding chains of
gold, and making ornaments of silver filagree.</p>

<p>We bought souvenirs at the stalls of the fez dealers,
where but one style of headgear was sold, always red
in color, and with prices varying according to the
quality of the cloth and lining. We stopped at the warerooms
of the brass-smiths, which were larger in size
than the ordinary shops, and found these filled with an
array of hammered trays, censers, bowls, tankards,
curiously wrought lamps, and ornamented candlesticks,
that attracted many buyers. We looked into the little
factories of the saddlers, which were gay with red
and yellow trappings for donkeys and horses, and
where the saddlers were stitching with bright colored-threads.</p>

<p>The light open-front workshops of the makers of
hempen camel harness were hung with the twisted
rope and tassel adornments of variegated colors with
which the Bedouin delights to array his ship of the
desert. The stores of the grocers were adorned with
long decorated candles suspended by the wicks. We
saw hundreds of tiny bazaars for the sale of perfumes,
placed side by side in a narrow lane where the air was
scented with musk and attar of roses; and we walked
through narrow streets where, each kind in its own
section, earthen water jars, lanterns, books, ornamented
leather work, gems, and precious stones were displayed
for sale.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span></p>

<p>The guide insisted that we should spend a little time
in the carpet stores in a side street. We yielded to his
entreaties, and were surprised by the immense stacks
of exquisite silk rugs; but to the courteous salesman's
offer to show us everything in his place, we were compelled
by lack of time to reply, "Another day." When
we arrived at the more prominent silk bazaars, the
ladies wished to buy some light shawls interwoven with
gold thread and table covers embroidered with silk.
They soon found out, however, that, as in the other
Oriental cities, much time would be required for bargaining,
and so the shopping was put off until the sight-seeing
was over.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>

<p>The Nile party No. 2, consisting of forty-two persons,
left Cairo on Friday morning, March thirteenth,
in sleeping cars. The cars were painted
white outside, finished in cherry inside, and divided into
rooms, each room having two comfortable berths and a
washstand, and a passageway along the side of the car.
We ate our dinner that evening and breakfast the following
morning in a modern dining car attached to the
train.</p>

<p>At nine o'clock on Saturday morning the train
arrived at our destination, the town of Luxor, about
four hundred miles south of Cairo. The Hotel de
Luxor, at which we stayed, was situated in the midst
of a large irrigated garden where palms cast a grateful
shade and roses and lilies bloomed among tropical
plants. Within this hotel, built with thick stone walls
and floored with flagstones, the tourists found a pleasant
refuge from the heat when they returned from
excursions into the desert. In its cool dining room,
decorated in the old Egyptian style with figures of gods
and goddesses, with lotus blossoms and papyrus flowers,
with hieroglyphics and symbols, painted on frieze,
walls, and window sash, the tourists were waited on by
white-robed, white-turbaned, red-sashed, red-slippered
natives.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span></p>

<p>The flies were a great pest. They were numerous
and annoying, although we found that they did not
bite so hard nor tickle the skin so much as do the flies
in our country. Among the first purchases made by
the tourists in Luxor were fly brushes made of palm
fiber or of white horsehair with wooden handles and
loops to attach them to the wrist. It was amusing to
see English, German, and American tourists switching
at the flies with their horsetail brushes while the natives
passively endured the crawling insects. Egyptian
mothers in the village permitted the flies to creep over
the babies' faces and settle in clusters around their
eyes without attempting to drive the tormentors away,
either too lazy to do so or desirous that the babies
should become hardened to the annoyance. We pitied
the infants, however, and some of the ladies of our party
became very indignant over the indifference&mdash;cruelty
they called it&mdash;of the mothers. We saw many older
children afterwards whose skin appeared to be insensible
to the tickling feet; for they made no attempt to brush
away the flies which covered their faces.</p>

<p>Our party was joined during the morning by another
party of tourists. After luncheon we all proceeded to
the end of the shaded garden, where, at the gateway, we
found Mahmoud, the dragoman who had been selected
to take charge of the expedition. His assistants were
assembled there and with them were eighty donkey
boys, each with his donkey, a number of jinrikisha men
with carts, and chair men with chairs. The donkey
boys were of all ages from lads scarcely in their teens to
veterans of three-score years. The donkeys were of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
various sizes but the largest were not over four feet high.
The jinrikishas had each two attendants, one man to
pull in the shafts of the cart and one to push. The
chairs borne on poles on the shoulders of men had each
six carriers, four to carry and two as a relay. Chairs
or jinrikishas were chosen by the tourists whose bodies
required careful treatment and by those who preferred to
travel in luxury. The donkeys, however, were selected
by the majority, who considered it a far greater pleasure
to ride.</p>

<p>"This way! this way! ladies and gentlemen, if you
please!" exclaimed Mahmoud, and the merry cavalcade
of eighty tourists and one hundred attendants started<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
off through the village, donkey boys chattering, donkeys
braying, and riders gaily chaffing one another on their
appearance in the saddle; the long-legged professor
holding up his feet to prevent them from scraping the
ground and the jolly stout parson mounted on the
smallest donkey. Each donkey was followed by a
donkey boy who whipped the patient beast, jabbed him
with a sharp pointed stick, twisted the animal's tail, or
talked to him in Arabic, when it was necessary to urge
him to greater speed. When urged, the donkeys were
fast walkers. But whether the donkeys were walking,
trotting, or galloping, the boys with little exertion
managed to keep close to their heels, and the jinrikisha
men and chair men could keep up such a rapid speed
with their loads that it was difficult to leave them in the
rear.</p>

<p>My donkey boy, aged about sixteen, told me that his
name was Abda Mohammed and that the medium sized
white donkey on which I rode was known as Alice
Lovell. With broad smiles which showed a perfect set
of white teeth, he repeated over and over again, at
intervals during the short ride, "Alice Lovell, nice
donkey, good donkey. Abda, nice boy, good donkey
boy," doubtless thinking that if I could fully realize
that fact the backsheesh at parting would be larger.</p>

<p>A half hour's ride on an embanked road across fields
and desert sands brought us to the ruins of a great arch,
formerly one of the gateways into the magnificent
ancient temples of Karnak, but now an entrance way
to the famous ruins. There, the Egyptian guards
ordered us to show our government permits, or monu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>ment
tickets, as our dragoman called them, without
which we could not inspect the ruins.</p>

<p>"Oh! I have forgotten my ticket!" said one of the
tourists. "I left it with my satchel. What shall I do?"</p>

<p>At luncheon before starting Mahmoud had cautioned
the tourists to be careful not to forget their permits,
and his cautionary words, "Monument tickets are very
much wanted," were familiar and often repeated. A
hurried consultation was held and the difficulty overcome,
but the forgetful one and others were warned that
it must not occur again.</p>

<p>In order to provide a fund to be used in excavating,
preserving, and caring for the ancient temples and
tombs, the Egyptian government requires a permit costing
six dollars to be taken out by each person desiring
to visit these places, and without such a permit he
cannot enter. At Cairo the managers of the tour had
obtained from the government for each member of the
Nile party a little cloth bound "Service des Antiquites
L'Egypte" made out in the name of the holder. This
open-sesame for the iron gates was given to each person
with the warning that it must not be forgotten.</p>

<p>We stopped to view and kodak one of the huge
Propylons or outer gate ways and found there some
visitors who had driven to Karnak in modern carriages
instead of using the Oriental way of conveyance that
we had taken. An avenue of Sphinxes with rams' heads
was also stowed away in the kodak to be brought to
light at some future time.</p>

<p>"These stupendous ruins of Karnak," said the dragoman,
"were once a group of magnificent temples cover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>ing
an area of many acres. The most ancient of the
structures was built over forty centuries ago. Other
temples were added and alterations and improvements
made during the ages following when the city of Thebes
was a prosperous capital; but for over two thousand
years these places of worship have been abandoned
and the sand of the desert has collected around them,
almost burying them out of sight. The Egyptian government
for a number of years has had many natives
excavating, and also has been raising some of the fallen
columns."</p>

<p>As we passed through the temple grounds we saw a
number of men and boys at work, as the dragoman had
stated. These excavators scooped the sand and debris
into small baskets, while a taskmaster stood over them,
whip in hand. Then placing the filled baskets on their
heads they started off in long lines, singing as they
marched to the deposit heap. The men, we were
informed, earned twenty-five cents a day at this labor,
and the boys ten to fifteen cents a day.</p>

<p>"One thing noticeable about these most magnificent
ruins in the world," continued the guide, as we halted
in the great court, "is that the architecture, the sculpture,
the inscriptions, of the earlier temples is equal, if
not superior, to the workmanship of a later date. The
construction work done under the great kings Ramses
I, Seti I, Ramses II, and Amenophis III, who ruled over
Egypt thirteen centuries before the Christian era, has
never been surpassed. Stones of immense size were
handled by their architects in some manner unknown
at the present day, and walls and columns were erected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
of such solidity and strength that they have endured
through these many ages. The First Pylon or gigantic
portal to the Temple of Ammon, which was dedicated
to Ammon-Re, the King of the Gods, is three hundred
and seventy-two feet wide, with walls sixteen feet thick
and one hundred and forty-two feet high. The wonderful
Hypostyle Hall, or Hall of Columns, is three
hundred and thirty-eight feet long by one hundred
and seventy feet broad."</p>

<p>"Before we enter, let me read you what the noted
Egyptologist Rawlinson says with reference to this
Hall of Columns," said the professor, drawing out his
note book. "He writes: 'The greatest of all Seti's
work was his pillared hall at Karnak, the most splendid
single chamber that has ever been built by any architect,
and even in its ruins one of the grandest sights that the
world contains."</p>

<p>The huge columns, some in place, some leaning, and
others prostrate, were an impressive sight. The guide
called our attention to the inscriptions that covered
all the columns and to the traces of coloring that might
still be seen on the protected parts. In order that we
might more fully realize their size, he suggested that we
measure the circumference of one with our arms. It
required six of us with outstretched arms to span one of
the larger columns.</p>

<p>As we passed through the various halls, Mahmoud
interpreted and explained many of the historical inscriptions
and reliefs with which the ancient Egyptian kings
had covered the walls, commemorating the victories
they had gained over their enemies. One wall pictured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
the triumph of Shishak over Rehoboam, the son of
Solomon. The captured cities were represented by
circles each enclosing the name of the city; the captives,
by rows of Hebrews bound with cords. King Shishak
stood over the captives grasping a group of them by
the hair and smiting them with a club, and slaves carried
the golden treasures that had been stripped from the
temple at Jerusalem, and the plunder taken from
Rehoboam's palace.</p>

<p>On our return to Luxor my donkey boy Abda and I
had a disagreement. I gave him, as backsheesh, a tip
equal to a man's wages for a full day's work in Egypt;
but he pleaded with tears in his eyes for "more backsheesh,"
and departed apparently in great anger.</p>

<p>After resting awhile in the cool halls of our hotel, we
walked to the ruins of the great Temple in the village of
Luxor, close by the river bank and not far from the hotel.</p>

<p>"In the year 1884," said Mahmoud, as we assembled
around him in the ruins where the gigantic columns rose
forty feet above our heads, "I was living in a house that
stood just over where we are now standing and I did not
know that a part of the temple was buried in the earth
underneath. The government officials, after much
haggling and complaining about the prices my neighbors
and I demanded, bought the houses and lands of us,
about thirty properties in all, and gave us other lands,
so that the excavations could be continued. That
year this part of the temple was uncovered. The little
white mosque at the corner could not be purchased, as
that ground is sacred and must not be disturbed to
uncover ruins underneath it."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span></p>

<p>"This edifice, dedicated to the worship of Ammon,"
continued the guide, "was erected by King Amenophis
III thirty-three hundred years ago; but King Ramses
II, one hundred years later, added to the structure and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
made it a memorial of his reign by embellishing the
temple with statues of himself and covering the exterior
walls with reliefs and inscriptions picturing and describing
his triumphs."</p>

<p>We saw two colossal sitting statues of Ramses forty-five
feet in height, one of which was completely excavated,
the other buried breast high in rubbish, and in a
court of the temple were many gigantic standing figures
of Ramses placed between the pillars. Beside one of
these was a small figure, representing the queen Nefertari,
which just reached to the height of the knees of
Ramses.</p>

<p>"The king desired to indicate by the size of the statues
that he was a great conqueror," said the dragoman.
"His wife was the daughter of Pharoah who, while
bathing in the Nile, found the Hebrew babe hidden
among the papyri plants."</p>

<p>"If Nefertari was the princess who rescued Moses,
she deserved a larger statue," responded one of the
tourists.</p>

<p>"This series of scenes represents the victory at
Kadesh in Syria," explained the guide as we stood before
a wall covered with pictorial representations of
conflict cut in the stone. "Here is the King in his
chariot charging with fury on his foes amid flying arrows.
Notice the dead and wounded scattered over the field of
battle and the Hittites flying in confusion. At one side
you see the Egyptian camp, and on the other side the
fortress of Kadesh and the Syrian king amazed at the
sight of his army in wild flight. The hieroglyphics that
cover the side of the tower give a detailed account of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
the battle and of the glorious deeds of valor performed
by King Ramses. There were originally two large
obelisks here in front of the temple, but one of them
was taken to Paris a number of years ago."</p>

<p>"Yes, I saw it there," remarked one of the party,
"but the inscriptions on the one at Paris looked worn
and weather-beaten; while those on this obelisk are
almost as distinct as when they were cut in the pink
granite three thousand years ago."</p>

<p>On the morning of March fifteenth, after an early
breakfast, we started at seven o'clock to visit the
Tombs of the Kings and the temples on the west side
of the Nile,&mdash;the village of Luxor and the temples of
Luxor and Karnak being on the east side. Crossing
the river in ferry boats propelled by sails and oars, the
tourists found donkeys, boys, chair-men, lunch carriers,
guides, and extra men crowding the western shore.
We had hardly landed when the donkey boys surrounded
us, gesticulating, shouting the merits of themselves
and their beasts, and pleading that their donkeys might
be selected. Much to my surprise, Abda, the offended
and angry boy of the Karnak ride, pushed his way to
my side with Alice Lovell and smilingly claimed me as
his friend and benefactor, with the familiar tale: "Alice
Lovell a good donkey; Abda a good donkey boy," so
our relations were renewed.</p>

<p>The ladies decided that the men's saddles would be
more comfortable for a long ride, and that there would
be less danger of the saddle turning; so side saddles
were generally dispensed with and most of the women
mounted astride. From the landing we rode slowly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
over a long stretch of loose sand, tiresome to the donkeys,
and then along a good path on the embankment of an
irrigating ditch. The sun was sending down hot rays
by the time we reached our first halting place, the Temple
of Kurna, and we were glad to dismount and seek shelter
and rest in the shade of the great walls while we examined
the beautifully executed reliefs and inscriptions.</p>

<p>In the treasure chamber of the temple, Mahmoud related
the story of the architect who built the chamber
for King Seti. "This rascal of an architect," said
Mahmoud, "left one stone loose so that he could secretly
remove it and enter the chamber to steal. The robber
was caught in the act of carrying off the treasure and
fittingly punished as you may see represented in the
reliefs on the walls. This man pictured here in disgrace
and chains as a warning to ill-doers was the first thief in
Egypt, but I am sorry to say he was not the last."</p>

<p>After leaving the Temple of Kurna, which is situated
near the cliffs that bound the Nile valley, our procession
entered a narrow ravine through which the path leads to
the Tombs of the Kings. Here we met another large
party of Americans and we all rode together for some
distance, one of the tourists meeting a friend whom
she had not seen for seven years. We passed two
Englishmen with their guide, who moved off the path
and gazed through their eye-glasses in mild astonishment
at our animated cavalcade in varied costumes;
while we in turn looked at their immaculate sporting
outfits and thought how lonely the couple must be,
traveling through these dismal solitudes. Our party
had not thought it worth while to purchase special<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
riding outfits for the few days in the desert, but had
utilized what they had. For protection from the sun
some used white helmets or cloth neck protectors, some
covered their heads and necks with veils or tied down
their soft hats, others wore straw hats or caps regardless
of sunburn.</p>

<p>Overhead was an unclouded sky; at each side rose
yellow limestone cliffs glaring in the noonday sun, and
underneath white sand and limestone chips reflected the
burning rays. Not a sign of vegetation relieved the eye
in this waterless gorge during our one hour's ride from
Kurna to the Tombs.</p>

<p>"Backsheesh! backsheesh!" demanded the donkey
boys, as we dismounted.</p>

<p>"Why do you want backsheesh now?"</p>

<p>"Boy don't want backsheesh, donkey want backsheesh,
donkey eat hay while man in tombs."</p>

<p>In order that the Tombs may be satisfactorily examined
by visitors, the government has built an electric
light plant in the gorge and the thirty-five tombs are
illuminated by electricity. Our party entered and
examined the six of these tombs which are considered
the most interesting. At each of these an Egyptian
guard politely scrutinized the "Services des Antiquites,"
although it was printed in French that he could not
read, and then permitted the holder to enter.</p>

<p>In Tomb No. 17, we descended a passage hewn in the
limestone cliff, about ten feet wide, ten feet in height,
and three hundred and thirty feet in length, which leads
inward and downward by inclines and steps to the resting-place
of King Seti, a tomb prepared during his life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
to be the receptacle for his mummified remains after
death. The smooth polished walls and ceilings of the
corridors and chambers were sculptured by the best
artists of Seti's time with reliefs of great beauty, representing
scenes of a sacred character. The praising of the
great God Ammon-Re, the offering of incense and gifts
to various deities, the passage of the boat of the sun,
the punishments in the underworld, the sacred sun-disk,
animal-headed gods, patron goddesses, fierce
demons, sacred animals, winged serpents, flying spirits,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
evil genii, coiled snakes, and creeping scarabs are portrayed
repeatedly.</p>

</div>

<p>Mahmoud explained the pictures and inscriptions as
we slowly went forward, stopping frequently to inspect
more closely those of greater interest.</p>

<p>"After Seti's death," said Mahmoud, as we stood in
the chamber of the tomb, brilliantly lighted by the
electric bulbs, "his body was embalmed and with great
pomp and ceremony the mummy was carried from the
palace in the great city of Thebes through the dismal
gorge and deposited in a magnificent alabaster sarcophagus
that had been prepared for its reception in this
chamber in the limestone rock ninety feet below the
surface of the ground. Then the tomb was closed and
sealed so that the body of the king might remain in
peace until it should be called forth at the end of time
to undergo trial before the god Osiris.</p>

<p>"For hundreds of years, the mummy lay tranquilly
in its sealed tomb; then the seals were rudely broken and
the tomb was despoiled by robbers who wished to
obtain the valuables deposited with the body. When
this despoliation was discovered, the rulers of the Empire
removed Seti's mummy and the mummies of other
kings to a tomb near the Temple of Der-el-bahri which
could be more closely guarded. There the mummies
remained until the year 1881, when they were taken
away to the Museum at Cairo."</p>

<p>"And now," said one of the visitors, as the guide
concluded, "after thirty centuries of repose, the proud
features of this oppressor of the Israelites, little the
worse for the lapse of time, are exposed in the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
hall of the National Museum in Cairo to the gaze of the
rude multitude from whom he desired to be hidden, and
his alabaster sarcophagus is admired by visitors in the
Soane Museum of London."</p>

<p>Almost all the articles of value in the Tombs that the
robbers did not succeed in carrying away, as well as the
mummies and sarcophagi, have been removed to
museums in the large cities, the most valuable being
retained for the Museum in Cairo. In the tomb of
Amenophis II, however, the mummy of the king in a
decorated coffin remains for the inspection of visitors.
Above the head of this ruler of the ancient empire, a
modern electric bulb hangs, illuminating the rugged
features and showing every detail of high nose, sunken
cheeks, and straggling hair on the head and chin. The
tombs of Ramses III, Ramses IV, and Ramses IX were
interesting each in its own way. That of Ramses III
had, in addition to the sacred scenes, pictures of agricultural
and family life; plowing, sowing, reaping, baking,
slaughtering, and cooking.</p>

<p>"Shall we return through the gorge or take the
shorter path over the cliffs and obtain a view of the Nile
valley?" inquired the dragoman.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<p>Some, dreading the exertion under a broiling sun,
chose the level road on a donkey's back. Others, intent
on obtaining the view, started to climb the zigzag path
regardless of the glare of the sun, the donkey boys
following with the donkeys. The view from the summit
amply repaid us for the climb. On one side we looked
down into the desolate valley of the Tombs. On the
other we saw the rich green valley of the Nile, with groups<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
of palms, villages, and temples. Directly below at the
foot of the yellow cliff, and in strong contrast to it, was
the white marble temple of Der-al-bahri. And not far
from the temple was a cottage, which at once became
interesting to the tired party when the guide, pointing
to it, said: "That is the rest-house. A good luncheon
will be ready on the
tables when you arrive
there."</p>

<p>We had been riding
on a very narrow trail
along the edge of a
precipice, but now we
dismounted and descended,
on foot, a
winding path, too steep
and dangerous for riding,
that led us to the rest-house
in the valley below.
Here, at the
Chalet Hatasu, as it was
named, the servants had
unpacked the hampers
which they had brought
from the hotel at Luxor, and the hungry travelers
were soon seated around well-spread tables. During
the meal a throng of scantily clad men, boys, and
small children assembled outside the Chalet. These
bare-footed Arabs offered for sale scarabs, stone mummy
images, mummified feet, skulls, beads, and trinkets so
clamorously and persistently that our dragoman had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
use his long lashed whip to clear the way. After leaving
the chalet, naked boys, apparently from four to ten
years of age, followed us with outstretched hands, begging
for backsheesh. Some of these boys earned money
by posing to be kodaked.</p>

<p>The walls and columns of the Ramesseum, the
magnificent temple built by Ramses II, and those of
Medinet Habu, the great temple built by Ramses III,
were covered with pictures in relief, made in the golden
days of Theban prosperity.</p>

<p>"The ancient artists, to perpetuate their work, used
chisels on lasting stone instead of brushes on perishable
canvas," remarked the professor as we examined the
reliefs, "and their pictures carved on the stone walls
have endured through centuries."</p>

<p>We saw battle scenes with the king leading in the fray,
archers discharging arrows, charioteers riding down the
foe, and enemies fleeing in dismay; triumphal marches
with the king borne aloft on a canopied litter, fan-bearers
waving fans, musicians blowing trumpets and
beating drums, courtiers bearing standards, and captives
led in chains; festal processions with the king marching
in front, the sacred white bull festooned with wreaths,
maidens carrying flowers, and priests bearing images;
and nations paying tribute to the king upon his throne,
Nubians bringing leopard skins, giraffes, and grinning
apes, and princes presenting gems, costly vases, and
golden shields. One picture at Medinet Habu represented
the soldiers cutting off the right hands of their
enemies who had been slain in battle and bringing these
gruesome emblems of the dead to the secretaries to be
counted and recorded. The secretaries had counted
and recorded twelve thousand five hundred and thirty-five
hands. To enumerate the many interesting scenes
sculptured on the temple walls would be like cataloguing
a picture gallery.</p>

<p>At the Ramesseum, the enormous Colossus of Ramses
lay broken on the ground, overthrown by some mighty
force.</p>

<p>"This huge granite figure," said Mahmoud, "was,
before its fall, the largest statue ever carved out of one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
block of stone. Its height was nearly sixty feet, the
fingers three feet long, and its weight has been estimated
at one thousand tons."</p>

<p>The Colossi of Memnon, the two enormous seated
figures in the midst of level cultivated fields, were
passed and photographed as we returned to Luxor.
Their hugeness may be judged by comparing their size
with the height of the tourists alongside in the illustration.</p>

<p>"During the weeks of inundation each year," said
Mahmoud, after he had told us the dimensions of the
statues and the mythical stories associated with them,
"these grain fields as far as the vegetation extends are
covered with water to a depth of from ten to fifteen feet.
When the Nile is at its height the heads of the great
Colossi, surrounded by water, rise forty feet above the
flood."</p>

<p>A bath and a thorough brushing of clothes at the hotel
removed the desert sand. We sipped our afternoon tea
in the shaded garden and then the party of forty-two
persons boarded the Nile steamer Amasis in time for
an evening dinner on the boat. Suit cases and satchels
were unpacked and the staterooms made cozy, for the
Amasis was to be the tourists' home for a number of
days during the trip down the Nile.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">ON THE NILE.</p>


<p>At daylight on Monday morning, March sixteenth,
the Amasis steamed away from Luxor and by
nine o'clock had arrived at the landing for
Dendera. The donkey boys of Dendera, having been
notified of our coming, were waiting with their donkeys.
In a few minutes the tourists were mounted for a half
hour's ride on narrow paths through green barley fields
to the ruined temple. I rode on a donkey named Whiskey
and Soda, with my donkey boy Hassan running
behind prodding the animal occasionally with a sharp-pointed
stick, and yelling "Haow! Haow!" to urge
Whiskey and Soda to a more rapid gait. Along the paths
through the fields many children ran to greet us with
outstretched palms. Their costumes were those of the
Garden of Eden before the fall; but having been informed
of our approach, the bronze colored youngsters had decorated
themselves for the occasion with wreaths of green
barley around their waists and crowns of the same
material on their heads. The little Arabs, bright-eyed,
smooth-limbed, and handsome featured, attractive and
picturesque in appearance, shouted with glee when a
few small coins were thrown among them.</p>

<p>"Look at that!" exclaimed one of the party. "I
have heard of the shepherds carrying the lambs on their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
shoulders, but here is a man coming with the foal of a
donkey in his arms."</p>

<p>"What a dear little pet," said the ladies as the Arab
passed us with the young donkey nestling contentedly
on his breast.</p>

<p>"The famous Temple of Dendera was not so magnificent
nor so large as the temples of Karnak and Thebes,"
said the guide, as we stood before the gates, "but it was
more richly decorated with carvings and paintings.
Every inch of column, wall, and ceiling was carved with
hieroglyphic and pictorial decorations. These were
painted in bright colors which are yet faintly visible.
This structure is a modern one compared with Karnak;
for Karnak was an ancient temple more than one
thousand years old when King Ptolemy began the
erection of this building just before the Christian Era.
An inscription on the walls states that the time required
for its construction was one hundred and eight years,
six months, and fourteen days. When Egypt became a
Roman province after the death of Cleopatra, the Roman
emperors continued the construction of the unfinished
temple. Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and
Nero are represented in reliefs on the walls. The temple
was dedicated to the worship of the Goddess Hathor,
the Egyptian Venus, or goddess of love and beauty."</p>

<p>"Why was the temple built here two miles away from
the river, instead of near the banks of the Nile?" inquired
a tourist.</p>

<p>"It was because this terrace is higher than the valley,"
answered Mahmoud. "Remember that these green
fields through which we rode are made fertile by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
overflow of the Nile; then I think that the reason for
building on this plateau will be plain to you."</p>

</div>

<p>"But why was it built in a depression?"</p>

<p>"It was not originally in a hole," explained the guide,
"but was built on level ground. Some sixteen hundred
years ago the Christian Roman Emperor Theodosius
forbade the worship of idols. After that time, the
worship of the goddess Hathor being discontinued, the
temple was neglected and a village of mud huts sprang
up around it. These huts, built of sun-dried bricks,
crumbled to dust in the passage of years and were
trampled under foot. Again and again new huts
supplanted the old until in the course of centuries the
debris accumulated many feet in depth. When the
government, fifty years ago, undertook to restore the
temple, the workmen had to begin by shoveling mud
huts off the roof."</p>

<p>We descended a long flight of steps to reach the level
of the floor of the excavated temple, and passing the blue-uniformed
guards entered the grand hall of columns.
The hall, as the guide had told us, was richly decorated.
Master sculptors had carved every available space on
the walls and columns with hieroglyphic inscriptions
and beautiful reliefs; master artists in color had heightened
the effect with tint and shade. Looking up we
saw, pictured on the ceiling, the Egyptian deity, Nut,
the goddess of the sky, controlling the movements of sun
and stars; the rays of the sun shining in blessing on the
head of Hathor; the moon issuing from Nut's mouth;
the signs of the Zodiac; the flying Hours of day and
night; and the sailing boats of the planets.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span></p>

<p>The guide raised a stone trap door less than two feet
square in the stone floor and through this small entrance
we squeezed, candle in hand, and descended a stone
stairway to explore the dark crypt underneath. Although
the ladies
screamed when the
bats, disturbed and
blinded by the
light, flew wildly
overhead, they
bravely followed
the guide. The
long passage was
but three feet in
width and we wondered
why the
dragoman had
brought us down
into its close and
gloomy recesses;
but when magnesium
wires were lit,
our wonder turned
into admiration,
for the sputtering
white light revealed
on the smooth sidewalls most beautiful reliefs in
well preserved coloring.</p>

<p>"Did you see anything remarkable in that dark
cellar?" inquired a voice from above as we ascended
through the trap.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why didn't you come along?" was the laughing
response.</p>

<p>"I've not trained down to the proper size yet,"
rejoined the fat man who could be jolly on all occasions.
"Do you think that a man of my size could squeeze
through a hole like that?"</p>

<p>By a long stone stairway of easy steps we ascended
leisurely to the roof, stopping frequently to admire the
ceremonial procession of priests pictured on the walls
of the staircase. From the flat stone roof we saw on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
one side the green cultivated fields extending to the
river's edge and on the other side the yellow desert
stretching to the distant cliffs.</p>

<p>"This is a picture of Cleopatra and her son Cæsarion,"
said Mahmoud, as we inspected the reliefs on the outer
walls, "and this is King Ptolemy offering incense to the
gods Osiris and Isis, and hawk-headed Horus their son.
Here also is Hathor's picture repeated many times."</p>

<p>The trip down the river Nile on the fine steamer
Amasis, which had been chartered for us, was thoroughly
enjoyed by the forty-two people who made up the party.
The staterooms were bright and clean and the meals
served were equal to those of a first class hotel. The
captain and his officials did all they could to make the
trip pleasant for us. Life on board was a life of ease;
the air though warm was balmy and restful, and cares
were forgotten. The centre of the upper deck was
roofed over but open at the sides with rugs on the
floor, easy chairs, small tables, and a piano. In this
open piazza-parlor we sipped the coffee that was served
to us there after luncheon and after dinner. There, too,
we partook of the tea and cakes that were handed around
at four o'clock, and when we returned from excursions
on shore, tired and warm, we found refreshing lemonade
ready to quench our thirst.</p>

<p>Our dragoman, Mahmoud Achmed, the Egyptian
conductor of all our sight-seeing excursions on land,
was an interesting character and became a great favorite.
He was a native of Luxor and while we were at that
place his bright-eyed little girl, neatly dressed, came to
meet us. Mahmoud had a fund of information regard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>ing
the history of the country, the legends of the gods,
and the fabulous deeds of the ancient kings. He had a
most interesting way of interspersing history with
mythical tales and humorous incidents, and so kept the
party in high spirits. Mahmoud was noted, too, for his
ability to answer intelligently all reasonable inquiries
and for his great patience in replying to many questions,
that must have appeared to him very silly. Each day
on the boat while we were all seated at dinner, Mahmoud
came into the dining saloon and announced the program
for the following days, always beginning: "Ladies and
gentlemen, if you please," and closing with, "Monu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>ment
tickets are very much wanted. Galloping donkeys
is not allowed."</p>

<p>For some one to mislay or forget a permit was a daily
occurrence and the caution had to be repeated often.
As to the donkeys, the riders paid no attention to the
restriction, but walked, trotted, or galloped the donkeys
as they felt inclined.</p>

<p>During the daytime Mahmoud wore a plain gown
suitable for traveling on shore in heat and dust, but in
the evenings he was resplendent in robes of silk. One
night, at the request of one of the ladies, he brought to
the mid-deck five handsome silk gowns to be inspected
by the tourists. He also brought his book of references
written by people whom he had conducted. In this we
read the dignified prose of preacher and college president,
the practical remarks of business men, and the
nonsensical lines of the rhymster. One of his feminine
admirers, seemingly impressed by the dragoman's silk
robes, polite attention, and general good humor, had
left the following jingle on the record:</p>

<p>Mahmoud took great pride in showing his many
references in prose and rhyme, and the members of our
party were glad to contribute in prose to his collection.
But at the end of the week we presented him with
another testimonial of a more practical kind.</p>

<p>"The Nile is a most wonderful river," remarked the
professor one evening as we sat on the open deck watching
the moonlight glisten on the green water. "Several
other rivers rival it in length; the Congo is noted for its
size; the Amazon, swelled by great tributaries, discharges
a volume of water immensely greater; and
the Missouri, including the Mississippi to the Gulf,
may be longer; but the Nile is unique in that for twelve
hundred miles it flows without a tributary through a
rainless region. Not a drop of rain nor a single brook
adds to its volume in all that distance, and a hot sun,
canals, ditches, sakiyehs, shadoofs, and water carriers
are continually taking away from it throughout every
mile of its winding course. The river is wider here but
it has less volume than one thousand miles farther up
the stream. It is unique also in the regularity of the
annual inundations, which begin on almost the same day,
continue the same length of time, and rise to an almost
similar height each year, and have done so annually for
untold centuries. In our land a flood is a disaster causing
loss and sorrow; in this country it is a blessing producing
wealth and joy. When the slowly rising waters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
each year reach the figures on the stone column of the
Nilometer which show that the Nile has spread abroad
his fertile bounty by covering the cultivable lands, and
has filled the dams and ditches for future needs, the
news is spread abroad and the people rejoice with
festivities and processions."</p>

<p>Before taking the trip on the Nile we had thought that
the days on the river might become monotonous and
tiresome; but we found, on the contrary, that every
hour was full of interest. Each day some excursion on
shore was taken. One day the patient donkeys carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
the tourists on a long trip to the ruins of the great
temple of Seti at Abydos to view its sculptured columns
and famous list of kings. On another day carriages
conveyed us to the rock tombs on the limestone hills
above Assiout and we visited the bazaars and the noted
potteries of that busy town. On the last day of our
sail the donkeys of Bedrashen were called into service
for a ride through the palm forest and green fields, past
the fallen columns of Ramses, to Sakkara, the tombs
of the sacred bulls, and the pictured tombs of Ptahhotep
and Ti.</p>

<p>"This is the height of enjoyment," said a member
of our party one day while we were lounging in easy chairs
taking afternoon tea on the deck, and lazily watching
the panoramic scenes as the Amasis steamed down the
river.</p>

<p>It was scenes like these we looked upon. Along the
banks of the river at short intervals, the shadoof man,
or drawer of water, with his shadoof resembling an
old-fashioned spring-pole or well sweep, drew up his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
dripping bucket and lowered it again, his only garment
an apron at the waist.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Where the bank was very high, a series of two, three,
or four natives, each with his spring-pole, raised the
water one to the other until it reached the top and was
poured into the little channels that carried it over the
rich, but very thirsty soil of a rainless land. On the
river-bank, also, interspersed with the shadoofs of the
poorer class of agriculturists, the more prosperous
farmers, who were the happy possessors of buffaloes or
camels, lifted the irrigating water from the stream by
means of sakiyehs, or wooden power wheels, which
creaked unceasingly as the patient camels or buffaloes,
with eyes covered by blinders of mud, trod round and
round the wheel.</p>

<p>A large Dahabeah with rugs, easy chairs, and piano on
deck, and the stars and stripes hanging listlessly overhead,
floated by, propelled by fourteen Arab rowers&mdash;there
being no wind to fill the sails. A drove of gray<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
buffaloes, forty in number, were taking their bath,
splashing the water like a party of schoolboys in a
swimming pool. A group of women filled earthen jars
at the water's edge, and with the dripping jars on their
heads mounted the steep river bank. Here and there
were irregular groups of mud huts, intersected by
crooked alleys and surrounded by date palms, little
villages where doves were flying overhead and from
which came the sound of barking dogs to mingle with
the puffs of the steamer. Flat-bottomed boats freighted
with sugar cane lay with drooping sails in a noonday
calm, or, later in the day, sped before the evening breeze.
Near the pottery towns the river banks were dotted
with yellow water jars in scattered piles ready for shipment
to the city market. Immense stacks of the sugar-cane
just harvested had been brought to the shore for
conveyance to the sugar factories. And fields of cotton
covered with white bloom extended into the distance.</p>

<p>We could see, too, the fertile Nile valley, not more than
ten miles in breadth at its widest part, bounded on
both sides by ranges of yellow, barren cliffs. On the
western side the cliffs were farthest away; on the
eastern side the valley was narrow, and the cliffs were
sometimes distant, sometimes so near that they completely
crowded out the cultivable soil and approached
to the water's edge.</p>

<p>"There is something peculiar in the air of this dry
land," observed one of the tourists after sitting quiet
awhile. "The atmosphere lends a softness to the outlines
of distant objects and adds delicate tints in the
afternoon light. See how the barren cliffs are glorified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
with a flush of pink, the wheat fields are a brilliant
green, and the barley fields, almost ready for the harvest,
are golden. Even the mud huts and the white-washed
mosque of that village on the western shore have
lost their crude outlines and have become picturesque.
At sunset the western sky will change to crimson and
the eastern cliffs will change to gold. The sunsets,
though, are not so gorgeous in coloring, nor do they
show such striking contrasts as I have seen occasionally
in my western home, but they are beautiful."</p>

<p>During the latter part of our sail down the Nile, where
the river broadened and was shallow, we had some
interesting experiences with sandbars.</p>

<p>"This is the Amasis' last trip of the season," said one
of the officers as we stood on the upper deck at the bow
of the steamer watching two sailors poling below.
"The Nile always falls rapidly in the spring, the channels
change, new sandbars form, and navigation becomes
difficult. The water is now very low, and we have
to be careful and alert wherever the river broadens as
it does here before us."</p>

<p>On account of the indications of shallowness ahead
the Amasis was steaming very slowly, occasionally
merely drifting with the current. The two Arab boatmen
stationed in the bow continually tested the depth
of the water with poles and shouted in Arabic the results
of their measurements to the anxious commander on the
deck above. Notwithstanding these precautions, our
steamer occasionally scraped on the sandbars, sometimes
sticking on them for a short time.</p>

<p>"Surely this is an unlucky day," exclaimed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
captain later, looking at his watch as we came within
sight of a railroad bridge with a draw in it that was then
being closed for an approaching train. "It is now four
o'clock, and, according to the official rules, that drawbridge
is closed for the day and will not be opened for
steamers to pass through until nine o'clock to-morrow
morning. We shall have to anchor here until that time.
That last stop of half an hour on the sandbar robs us of
half a day's time."</p>

<span class="caption">SHOVING FROM ITS DECK WITH LONG POLES.</span>
</div>

<p>The delay at the bridge was provoking, but a greater
test of the temper of the officers and patience of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
passengers was to come. On Friday morning while at
breakfast we felt a jar that caused the vessel suddenly to
stop. We heard an unusual puffing of the engine
and felt vibrations that caused the steamer to tremble
and the dishes to rattle.</p>

<p>"What's the matter? What's the trouble?" cried
several.</p>

<p>"Struck another sandbar," laconically remarked the
doctor at the end of the table. "Eat your breakfast.
We'll be off in a few minutes."</p>

<p>But succeeding events proved that the doctor was a
false prophet. For during the next twenty hours the
Amasis lay helpless in the midst of the stream, notwithstanding
all the attempts of the officials and crew to
free her from the bar, and it was not until Saturday
morning that their efforts were crowned with success and
the steamer floated free.</p>

<p>However, we took the doctor's advice the first morning
and finished our omelet and coffee. Then we hurried
to the deck to investigate and ask numberless questions
of the worried officials. Our baggage had been packed
in anticipation of landing before noon at Cairo, which
was but sixty miles distant, and we feared that a delay
might interfere with our plans for a busy afternoon of
sight-seeing in the city.</p>

<p>"'Misery loves company,' says an old proverb. If
that is true we should be happy," remarked one of the
tourists as we gathered on the deck gazing at an animated
scene. "Look! There are thirty boats in the
same predicament as our own."</p>

</div>

<p>Within sight in different directions on the wide river<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
lay thirty loaded feluccas stranded on the bars, and in
addition to these were sixty-five others not aground.
Alongside of one laden with live cattle a dozen sailors
were in the shallow water, shouting and splashing,
endeavoring to push their sloop off the bar. On many
of the stranded sloops the sailors were transferring parts
of their cargoes to other boats which were not aground.
At some places the dark-hued laborers were shoveling
grain from a stranded felucca into a lighter one; at
others they were carrying unwieldy bundles of sugar-cane
from one deck to another. Here they were handling,
with much difficulty, large blocks of stone; there
throwing yellow water-jars one at a time, passing red-bricks
slowly, or shifting stacks of green clover from
deck to deck. They accompanied the work of disburdening
the vessels with strange cries and chants in which
the name of Allah noticeably recurred, occasionally
stopping to test the result of their labor by plunging
into the water and pushing the felucca, or by shoving
from its deck with long poles.</p>

<p>One of the officers of the Amasis with some sailors in
a row-boat carried an anchor to its cable's length from
the steamer and dropped it in the water, then a donkey-engine
on deck to which the cable was attached was
started and the steamer shook with the throbs of the
engine endeavoring to pull it off the bar toward the
anchor. Unsuccessful in tugging the steamer in that
direction, they raised the anchor into the row-boat
and took it to other locations one after another; but the
engine panted and throbbed in vain. In the meantime
the captain had gone to a village on the shore, had hired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
sixty natives, and brought them out in boats. The
Arabs, dropping off their long blue gowns, and arrayed
only in loin cloths, jumped into the water, which was
not over three feet in depth. Then, placing their
shoulders against the steamer, the gang of naked Arabs,
chanting in unison a prayer to Allah for help and protection,
pushed, or pretended to push, in order to assist
the puffing engine in its task. With intermissions for
rest, the pushing, the throbbing, and the chanting of
the Arabic song, "Allah il Allah, Allah il Allah," continued
during the remainder of the day.</p>

<p>There was so much of interest happening around them
that the passengers could scarcely take time to eat their
meals, and their disappointment in not reaching Cairo
was almost forgotten.</p>

<p>"This has been to me one of the most interesting days
of the trip. I will mark it with a red letter," said one
of our party in the evening. "I do not regret the delay.
I would not have missed those amusing and novel
sights for anything."</p>

<p>When efforts were resumed at dawn on Saturday, the
Amasis floated free, and before noon we arrived at Cairo.
Our joyous trip on the Nile, with its pleasant associations
of fellow voyagers, dragomen, donkey boys, temples,
tombs, and gallops over the sand, was at an end.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span></p>

<p>By noon on Sunday, March twenty-second, the various
parties had reassembled as one large family
on board the Moltke in the harbor of Alexandria,
and shortly afterward they saw the land of the palms disappear
from sight below the horizon. Friends and
acquaintances who had chosen different excursions on
land and had been separated for some time had many
experiences to relate to one another. Some, who had
taken the Damascus trip, gave a description of the magnificent
ruins of the famous temple of Baalbek and of the
enormous size of the granite blocks which lay scattered
over the ground at that place, and displayed bargains in
hammered brass and silken rugs which they had secured
in the bazaars of the oldest city in the world. Others,
who had taken a sail on blue Galilee and a journey on
horseback through the interior of Palestine, told of the
unexpected luxuries of camp life, of squalid villages and
more squalid inhabitants, of bridgeless streams that had
to be forded, of Arab camps and Bedouin chiefs, and of
towns, mountains, plains, and wells, the names of which
were familiar to the student of the Bible. They showed
to their friends albums in which they had pressed the
flowers gathered in villages where the Savior once
strayed, or culled in fields through which He probably
had trod. Some who had taken a carriage ride to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
Dead Sea and the River Jordan described the loneliness
of the road and the armed Bedouin protectors who
accompanied them, the dilapidated condition of Jericho,
the desolate shores and bitter salty taste of the Sea, the
muddy banks of the River Jordan and a row on the
rapid stream. Their souvenirs were vials filled with
salt water from the Sea, and bottles of the fresh, but not
very clear water from Jordan's stream.</p>

<p>"The only place where we were treated with disrespect
during our trip was in Hebron," said one of a
group around a table in the library. "There the natives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
were an ill-tempered set. They scowled as if resentful
of our presence, and when we were driving away some
hoodlums of the town threw chunks of mud and stone
after our carriage."</p>

<p>"That reminds me," said another, "of a picture I
want to show you. On the landing at Esneh up the
Nile we thought that our clothes would be torn to pieces
by the natives, but not through ill-will. The donkey
boys were so eager to secure our custom that a struggle
ensued in which donkey boys, donkeys, and tourists
were inextricably mixed until the dragoman used his
whip. My brother took a snap-shot of the scene just
as Achmet raised his whip."</p>

<p>Some of the tourists had stayed ten days in Jerusalem,
some twelve days in Cairo, others had been at Philæ
and the Cataract of the Nile. Each one was enthusiastic
over his trip and appeared to be satisfied with the
way in which the eighteen days in Palestine and Egypt
had been spent.</p>

<p>Monday dawned cloudy with some wind and rain, and
although the weather was not stormy, the boat had that
uneasy motion which had been felt once before on the
Mediterranean. Many of the tourists, believing prevention
better than cure, remained in their staterooms,
or, snugly wrapped, reclined in their steamer chairs on
deck and had luncheon served to them there, fewer than
half the seats at the dining table being occupied.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, however, the sea was as smooth as a
river. The "Captain's Dinner," which had been postponed
from the previous day on account of the weather,
was announced for the evening, and the dining room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
was handsomely decorated with flags, garlands of artificial
roses, and additional lights for the special occasion.
The depression of Monday was forgotten and the
tourists were in a happy humor.</p>

</div>

<p>At the dinner the Captain made a neat speech referring
to the pleasant relations during the voyage and the
separation which was shortly to take place. The
judge, in behalf of the passengers, responded in a jovial
vein. "Three cheers for the Captain" were given with
enthusiasm, followed by "He's a jolly good fellow,"
heartily sung. Every one arose as the orchestra played<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
"America," and later, when the stars and stripes were
dropped from overhead, all rose again to accompany
the orchestra in the "Star Spangled Banner." Then
the electric lights were turned out and while we sat in
darkness, the stewards and waiters, dressed in fantastic
costumes of various nations, entered and in a long
procession marched around the room, each waiter carrying
aloft an illuminated tower of ice-cream, and each
steward a dish of bonbons. When the bonbons, containing
whistles and fancy caps, were opened, the
dignity of judge, professor, and minister was laid aside
and the tourists were a joyous, noisy crowd of children.</p>

<p>While we were at dinner the promenade deck was
cleared of chairs, decorated with flags, and illuminated
with Chinese lanterns in preparation for a masked ball
which was to be the crowning and closing event of the
day. In this fancy-dress carnival many of the passengers
appeared dressed in fantastic gowns prepared
during the day, or as Orientals in costumes that had been
purchased in Eastern cities.</p>

<p>While the maskers and onlookers were enjoying the
music and sport, the Moltke was steaming northward
through the Strait of Messina. On the right shone the
lighthouses of Italy and the lights of the Italian town
of Reggio; on the left gleamed the flash-lights of Sicily
and long rows of twinkles revealed the location of the
large city of Messina.</p>

<p>On rising Wednesday morning we found the sea
perfectly smooth with scarcely a ripple to disturb its
blue surface. The Moltke was speeding through the
waters with an almost imperceptible motion. On our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
left was the island of Capri, famous for its blue grotto,
and the morning sunlight playing on its rugged shores,
revealed a white road cut in the rocky cliffs, zigzagging
up the side of the hill from the village at the base to the
village on the summit. As the steamer coasted the
Italian shore, we saw dimly through the mist the bay
and town of Salerno, then picturesque Sorrento perched
among the rocks, and, in the distance, fog-crowned
Mount Vesuvius with a thin column of smoke ascending
from the crater, and many towns and villages at its
base. Directly ahead of us were the bay of Naples and
the city, partially hidden from our sight by a fog. Just
before reaching the quarantine station a small steamer
crowded with passengers emerged from the fog and
crossed the course of the Moltke, narrowly escaping destruction.</p>

<p>The Moltke dropped anchor at quarantine and a
yellow flag was run to the top of the mast to remain
floating there until the Italian physician had completed
his examination and was convinced that there were not,
and had not been, any cases of plague, cholera, or contagious
disease on the ship. During the detention at
quarantine a large mail was brought on board. We
crowded eagerly into the office inquiring for letters.
The stewards, not taking time to distribute the mail in
the boxes, called out the addresses, and little thought
was given to anything else until letters and papers were
obtained and the news from home devoured.</p>

<p>The fog soon rolled away and Naples, beautifully
situated on the crescent-shaped shores of the bay, was
disclosed to view. From the deck of the steamer we saw a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>picture unsurpassed in color and composition by any
previously beheld, excepting, perhaps, the view of
Constantinople from the Bosporus, or the panorama
of Algiers seen from the sea; but each one of the three
pictures was unique and beyond comparison. But
here, as at Constantinople, distance lent an enchantment
to the view; for a closer inspection after landing revealed
on the white and yellow and pink buildings ravages of
time and unsightly stains of smoke and grime unnoticed
from the bay.</p>

<p>We had no sooner reached the street, ready for sight-seeing,
than the cabriolet drivers thronged about,
importuning us to ride in the low open carriages that
comfortably carry two persons.</p>

<p>"How much to the Cathedral?" we asked one of the
drivers, using an expression that we thought the Italian
might comprehend.</p>

<p>"One lira the course, one and a half lire the hour,"
he succeeded in getting us to understand.</p>

<p>"Only ten cents each. And it's fully two miles to the
Cathedral!" exclaimed my companion. "But we have
a number of places to visit," he added, "and it will be
better to engage the cab by the hour. Show him your
watch and make a note of the time."</p>

<p>At the entrance of the Cathedral, the beggars asking
alms reminded us of the description of similar scenes at
the gate of the Temple in the Savior's time. A blind
man standing by the door called loudly upon the passers-by
to have pity on him, a cripple seated on the steps
with rough crooked crutches by his side stretched out
his hand for aid, and a fat dirty woman with a tiny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
babe in her arms whiningly cried, "poveretta mia!
poveretta mia!"</p>

<p>The regular services in the Cathedral were over when
we entered, but many people were in the building.
Some were in silent adoration before the Cross at the magnificent
high altar; some were worshiping at the foot of
the Virgin, or praying at the shrines of the saints; others
were contritely kneeling at the confessional boxes with
faces close to the little grated windows, whispering
deeds of misdoing to the confessor within and awaiting
the father's words of penance or of absolution. We
followed a crowd of Italians who were going into a
chapel at the side where preparations were being made
for a special service. There being no pews or sittings
in the chapel, but a few plain chairs for hire, we
paid the verger two cents for the use of a chair and
waited. Wooden benches were placed in line to form
an aisle and a number of women and children knelt
at the benches, each holding a large unlighted candle.</p>

<p>A cardinal in a red robe came down the aisle, accompanied
by a surpliced acolyte bearing a cup of oil.
As the cardinal passed each kneeling person, he dipped
his thumb into the oil and then, repeating a formula,
made a sign of the cross with his thumb on the worshiper's
forehead. A priest in black cassock and a chorister
in white followed the cardinal, the priest wiping the
foreheads with a piece of cotton and the chorister taking
the candles which were handed to him as offerings to
the church.</p>

<p>The doors of the magnificently adorned Cathedral
were open to rich and poor alike; but the poor were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
in the majority, and among them appeared such cases
of slovenly poverty as we had not seen elsewhere,
not even in Jerusalem or Constantinople, for in the Moslem
cities fountains were at the gates of the mosques
and no worshiper entered the sacred edifice with soiled
hands or feet. Three cases of slovenliness we noted particularly.
A woman of middle age, with tangled hair,
torn, untidy dress and soiled, stockingless feet partially
covered by dilapidated slippers, was violating the
rules of the church by sidling up to strangers and
stealthily begging within the building; a boy, probably
sixteen years of age, hatless, shoeless, coatless, with
pantaloons in need of patches and body in need of
soap, stood gazing curiously at the ceremony; and a
man whose whole attire consisted of a ragged shirt and
cotton trousers, with marks of grime on hands, neck,
and face, leaned carelessly against a pillar with bare feet
thrust forward. But these were extreme and exceptional
cases of untidiness, the worshipers generally being neatly
clad and careful of their personal appearance.</p>

<p>The military band was playing on a platform when
we visited the park and the paths and the grass plats
were filled with people, many standing and a few seated
on chairs. Noticing some unoccupied chairs, we sat down
to listen to the music and watch the life and movement
of a Neapolitan crowd. We had scarcely taken our
places when a woman with a badge and a bag approached,
demanding ten centessimi for each seat.
"Gratia!" she said when paid, and "Gratia!" we responded,
grateful for a comfortable resting place.</p>

<p>"I thought, before we started on this trip, that sight-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>seeing
prolonged day after day might become monotonous
and that I might lose interest," remarked one of
the group seated on the chairs, "but, on the contrary,
I find continual variety. Our drive through the beautiful
residence section and suburbs on the heights this
morning was charming, and the extensive landscape
and marine view from the Convent of Camaldoli is
unsurpassed, save by the view from Mustapha Superieur.
Each place visited has differed so thoroughly
from all the others that my interest is as intense now as
when we landed at fascinating Funchal."</p>

<p>"In each city I am compelled to replenish my stock
of films; I find so many pleasing subjects," replied an
artist who always had his camera with him. "Did you
see those women on the hillside road at Capri carrying
wine kegs on their heads? They posed for me to take
a picture of the group. It was not necessary to tell
them to look pleasant; every face wore a smile. I am
sorry that my kodak does not reproduce colors. The
dresses of the women, though worn and faded, were
very picturesque in their combinations of scarlets, blues,
and yellows."</p>

<p>"And I regret that cameras cannot reproduce the
beautiful azure and silver tints of the interior of the
Blue Grotto just as we saw it yesterday," said one of the
ladies who was collecting photographs and postal cards.
"I want a good picture of the Grotto Azzurra but I
cannot find one. Those that are offered for sale are
such poor imitations."</p>

<p>After the concert was over, we entered the salt water
aquarium of Naples, which is famous throughout Europe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
as the finest and largest ichthyological collection in the
world. In the glass tanks curious sea fish darted
through the water, grotesque sea monsters crawled
over the pebbles, and transparent jelly fish floated
slowly; pink and white sea anemones, like a bed of
flowers, opened and closed, and diminutive sea animals,
almost invisible, spread thread-like tentacles; sponges
and coral grew upon the rocks, and mollusks showed by
their movements that they had life.</p>

<p>One evening we drove to the suburban village of
Posilipo and from the cliffs at that place saw the sun
descend in glory, a golden ball dropping into a radiant
sea. While we were returning, a picturesque beggar
with a crooked stick and one string across it trotted
alongside our carriage, trying to convince us that he was
a musician and his music worth a penny. At dusk, an
Italian boy ran alongside the carriage, opened and lit
the carriage lamps while the horse was moving at a rapid
gait, and asked for payment.</p>

<p>Naples is a city of striking contrasts. It was interesting
to study them. We drove over well paved streets,
admiring marble palaces, great hotels, and beautiful
homes; but with feelings very different from admiration
we walked through narrow, filthy thoroughfares, densely
populated, where networks of clothes lines with garments
of all colors hung overhead. We saw high-spirited
horses and superb carriages in the avenues and
parks, and teams of handsome cream-colored oxen in
the suburbs: but we saw also in the highways, small,
rough-coated donkeys overburdened with panniers of
fruit; tall, bony horses mismatched with diminutive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
donkeys; incongruous teams composed of a cow and a
donkey, or a large ox and a small cow; and a team even
more grotesquely made up of a horse, a cow, and a
donkey. We saw the elite of the city elegantly dressed
in the latest fashion promenading in the shopping districts;
but on the sidewalks of the tenement district we
saw slovenly barefooted women washing clothes, cooking
maccaroni, scrubbing children in a tub, and combing
children's hair with fine combs, regardless of our
curious gaze. Here, too, we saw boys, apparently eight
or ten years of age, playing in the streets with no other
clothing than a shirt reaching to the knees, and women
peddlers of mineral water dressed in ragged red blouses
and blue skirts, who, with disordered hair and stockingless,
slipshod feet, shuffled by pushing hand-carts filled
with earthen jugs.</p>

<span class="caption">PEASANT GIRLS THEIR BURDENS BEAR.</span>
</div>

<p>On the avenues street peddlers besought us to purchase
canes, matches, coral beads, and souvenirs cut out of
lava, but asked prices four or five times their actual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
value. On the narrow streets dealers in cooked viands
for the home trade did an active business at low prices,
but did not think it worth while to offer us the hot
potatoes, maccaroni, fried fish, and stewed meats which
they prepared on little sidewalk stoves.</p>

<p>The trip from Naples to Pompeii was made by rail in
less than an hour. At the gates of the enclosure we each
paid an admission fee of two lire, or forty cents, and
official guides were assigned to conduct the party through
the streets of the excavated city.</p>

<p>"About one hundred and fifty years ago," explained
the guide, "a farmer ploughed up some objects of art in
this locality. The government, hearing of the discovery,
ordered investigation to be made. Removal of the soil
disclosed a house and furniture and articles of value.
The excavations, carried on irregularly for a century,
then continued regularly but slowly for the past fifty
years and still in progress, revealed the ancient city that
had been smothered in ashes and buried from sight for
eighteen hundred years. The wooden roofs, crushed in
by the weight above them, had crumbled into dust, but
the walls and columns, the altars and statues, the fountains
and baths, the paved streets and mosaic pavements,
and the frescoes on the walls had been preserved by the
covering of ashes, and were in almost as good condition
as when deserted by the terror-stricken inhabitants. All
articles of value, as soon as found by the excavators,
were carried away to the museums and carefully preserved;
but the uncovered walls were left exposed to the
weather, and, as you will see, are badly damaged and
defaced. The government for the past few years, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>ever,
has been protecting the newly excavated buildings
by enclosing and roofing them over, and in these
we shall find the beautiful Pompeian red and blue colors
and the dainty frescoes well preserved on the walls."</p>

<span class="caption">BEARING PANNIERS OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES.</span>
</div>

<p>This ancient city of probably only twenty-five thousand
inhabitants had improvements that we now designate
as modern. The streets, just wide enough for
one wagon track with narrow footways on each side,
were paved with square flat stones in which the chariots
had cut deep wheel ruts. The public baths had separate
rooms for men and women, exercise courts, sweating
rooms, furnace heat, hot baths, cold baths, capacious
marble plunge tanks, and cooling rooms in which the
bathers, cleansed, oiled, and perfumed, could rest after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
the bath. The water supply was distributed through
the city in the same manner as in our own cities. Lead
water pipes conducted the water through streets and
into buildings. Bronze stopcocks governed the fountains,
and bronze inlets and outlets regulated the supply
at the marble baths.</p>

<p>"The Pompeian plumbers used good material and did
good work," commented a manufacturer after examining
the plumbing.</p>

<p>"If I could produce paints that would endure for
centuries, and have them laid on as the Pompeian artists
applied them, my fortune would soon be made," remarked
another, who had been impressed particularly
by the brightness of the red and blue on the walls of the
House of Sallust. "But," he added, "the secret of
making paint that will endure the ravages of time has
been lost."</p>

<p>In a baker's shop we saw four small stone mills in
which grain had been converted to flour by hand power,
the stones having been revolved by means of long wooden
handles. Near the mills was an oven similar to those
of the present time.</p>

<p>"In this oven a number of loaves of bread were
found," said the guide.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered one of our party, "we saw fourteen
loaves in the Museum of Naples yesterday and were told
that it was the oldest bread in existence. The loaves
were well preserved in form but were as black as charcoal."</p>

<p>Our interest in Pompeii was heightened by our previously
having visited the Naples Museum, where a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
multitude of articles found during the excavations were
on exhibition. There we had examined hundreds of
objects of art, marble statues, bronze statues, mosaics,
vases, frescoes, and paintings; we had seen thousands
of ornaments for personal adornment, necklaces, cameos,
bracelets, rings, chains, and toilet accessories and
had looked at numberless articles for household use, such
as stoves, lamps, dishes, and kitchen utensils. Even food
was not lacking in the exhibition, being represented by
olives in a jar, oil in bottles, charred walnuts, almonds,
figs, wheat, and eggs. These things, abandoned by the
fugitives in their wild flight, helped us to imagine the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
taste and manner of living of the Pompeians before the
destruction of their city.</p>

<p>"This is the Amphitheatre," said the guide, as we
assembled around him in the arena of a large structure.
"Here fights between wild beasts, gladiatorial combats,
and other great spectacles took place. Underneath the
seats on one side are the dens where the lions and tigers
were kept in a starving condition to make them ferocious,
and underneath on the other side are the dungeons
where prisoners were confined until forced into
the arena to meet the wild beasts. On the hill nearby
are the barracks where the gladiators lived and trained
for combats." An announcement of an oldtime entertainment
remains inscribed on one of the stone walls.
It reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>Twenty pairs of gladiators, at the expense of Decimus, a
priest, and ten pairs of gladiators, at the expense of Lucretius,
will fight at Pompeii on the eleventh of April. There will be a
complete hunting scene, and the awnings will be spread.</p></blockquote>

<p>Another inscription on the wall stated:</p>

<blockquote><p>On the dedication of the baths, at the expense of Maius,
there will be a hunt, athletic sports, showering of perfumes,
etc., at the Amphitheatre.</p></blockquote>

<p>"There was also a Tragic Theatre in Pompeii," continued
the guide. "It was reserved for dramatic performances.
The stone tiers seated an audience of five
thousand. The Amphitheatre and the Tragic were
open to the sky, but both were provided with awnings
that could be spread above the seats to protect the
people from the sun."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span></p>

<p>Almost all of us had read Bulwer-Lytton's novel,
"The Last Days of Pompeii," and were familiar with
his vivid description of the fearful eruption of Vesuvius
which overwhelmed the city in the year A.D. 79,&mdash;the
darkness, the terror of the people, the hasty flight, the
roar of explosions, the volcanic lightnings, the scorching
ashes, the sulphurous fumes, and the hot rain. Very
interesting to us were the places described by Bulwer
in his novel; the dwelling of the magistrate Pansa, the
villa of the wealthy Diomede where eighteen skeletons
surrounded by provisions and jewels had been found,
the house of the poet Glaucus whose threshold was
guarded by the mosaic of a chained dog with the now
well known motto 'Cave Canem' or 'Beware of the Dog.'
Most interesting, perhaps, was the Temple of Isis, in
which the most exciting incidents of Bulwer's novel
took place. There the guide showed us the altar, the
well, the secret stairway, the platform from which the
oracle spoke, and the spot where the skeleton of the
priest with an ax was found.</p>

<p>"Broken columns and ruined walls are all that remain
of the grandeur of the Forum," explained the guide as
he led the way through a triumphal arch into a large
area. "These extensive marble-paved floors were once
decorated with statues of the illustrious men of Pompeii."</p>

<p>"The Forum was a bustling place," he continued, as
we stood in the centre of the area. "In the open court
the people met to exchange opinions and obtain the
news. On the porticoes the money changers made
loans and the brokers sold real estate and grain. It was
the political center of the city. Here the magistrates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
administered justice. Here the populace met with joyful
acclamations to raise a favorite to power, and here,
too, angry mobs gathered to compel an offending ruler
to vacate his office. It was the religious centre as well;
for adjoining the Forum are the ruins of the Temple
of Mercury, the Temple of Venus, the Temple of Jupiter,
and the Temple of Augustus."</p>

<p>When we were ready to leave Pompeii, after a tramp
through other streets and a visit to the Museum, the
subject of giving a fee to the guide was considered. At
the gate when entering we had read a notice stating that
guides furnished by the government were not permitted
to accept fees from visitors. The guide assigned to us,
however, had been very obliging and had given much
interesting information. Appreciating this we slipped
into his hand secretly at parting a token of our good will.
"Gratia! Gratia!" very heartily he responded, assuring
us that our gift, the forbidden, was acceptable.</p>

<p>After returning from Pompeii to our steamship we
found that although the evening hours had arrived, the
harbor was still a scene of animation. Scores of Italian
stevedores were carrying baskets of coal on their
shoulders from barges into the bunkers of the Moltke.
Near by other laborers were hoisting crates of lemons
and oranges and lowering them into the hold of an
English steamer. A little rowboat with a stove on
board was running a brisk restaurant business, selling
bread, coffee, fried eggs, fried potatoes, and fried fish
to boatmen and laborers, who managed to devour the
viands without assistance of plate, knife, or fork.</p>

<p>Alongside our steamer a number of boys in a rowboat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
were making a distracting noise with tin pans and crude
instruments, looking up in the hope that some one would
pay them for creating a disturbance. In another boat,
gaily attired Neapolitan musicians played and sang
popular airs in a pleasing way that drew coins from the
pockets of the hearers. At the close of each piece of
music one of the women held a spread umbrella upside
down to catch the coppers that were dropped into it
from the deck thirty feet above.</p>

<p>"The daylight ends too soon," regretfully observed
one of our party, an artist of considerable reputation,
who, seated in his favorite nook near the stern, was
endeavoring to complete his color notes and sketches
of the picturesque scenes before the darkness hid them
from view. "But the sky above the mountain is
reddening and the glow of Vesuvius will give me work
for to-night."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">NICE AND MENTONE.</p>


<p>Throughout the cruise to the Orient, up to the
time of departure from Naples, our party of
tourists had the great steamer to themselves,
there being no other passengers on board. At Naples,
however, a change took place. As the Steamship
Company granted us the privilege of remaining over
in Europe and returning later in the season in some
other steamer of the same line, a large number of the
tourists left the Moltke at Naples for side trips on the
Continent, and many more intended to leave at Nice;
so that not more than one-fourth of the original number
was booked to return direct from Nice to New York.
During the time our steamer lay at Naples a cargo of
freight was taken on board, and on the day of departure
one thousand steerage passengers ascended the gangway,
some with valises of curious shape, a few dragging
trunks, but the greater number with all their possessions
in bags or bundles.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock on the night of March thirtieth, we
stood at the rail watching the lights on the shore gradually
disappearing from sight as the Moltke steamed
away from the harbor.</p>

<p>"What must be the thoughts of these Neapolitan
exiles as they sail away from 'Sunny Italy,' their place
of birth, their homeland, and their friends?" mused my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
friend, referring to the emigrants gazing farewell to
their native land.</p>

<p>"There is sadness in their hearts, for their faces and
attitudes show it," said he, answering his own question.
"Some of the women are shedding tears. But they are
all hopeful. They have heard that in the promised
land there is plenty of work, high wages, enough to eat,
and, what is far better, opportunity to rise. In Italy
there is scarcity of work, low wages, a chunk of black
bread, and nothing better to look forward to in the
future."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are right, young man, there is something to
look forward to in America, an opportunity to rise in the
world," said a fellow tourist, well known as a man of
wealth and distinction. "I can sympathize with these
poor people who are seeking to better their condition.
Thirty years ago I was a poor man, leaving Europe in
the steerage as an emigrant to the land of promise. I
worked my way to the West, became a miner, and met
with success."</p>

<p>"To reach America appears to be the desire of many
in Italy," remarked another. "In the elevator of one
of the hotels in Naples I found the elevator boy studying
an English spelling book. He said, 'I am going to
America as soon as I have money enough; there is a
chance for me to become something if I can get to New
York.' A cab driver asked me if I knew his cousin in
Chicago. 'My cousin,' said he, 'saved enough money
to buy a third-class passage to New York. That was
just three years ago. Now he is sending money home to
his friends to take them over. He must be doing well.
We never have any money to give away.' Money to
spare for his friends! That told the cabman the story
of a golden land."</p>

<p>On Tuesday, as we sailed northward, we passed the
island of Elba, on which the banished Napoleon remained
ten months after his abdication. We endeavored
to recall the history of the events that preceded
the great Emperor's first downfall; the campaign in
Russia, the burning of Moscow, the winter retreat, the
depletion of the grand army by frost and hunger. But
when the little island of Monte Cristo came in sight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
memory brought to mind pleasanter recollections,&mdash;Dumas'
story of the "The Count of Monte Cristo," so
wonderful in our youthful days, Edmond Dantes'
escape from the dungeon, the cave on the island, and the
fabulous wealth concealed therein.</p>

<p>On the day of arrival at Nice, hundreds of owners of
automobiles from all parts of Europe were assembled
in that city for trials of speed; the morning races had
taken place and the dust-covered racers were just coming
in from their fast runs. On the way to the hotel we
saw an automobile run over one man and knock another
down. An excited French woman who was rolled over
in the dust but not injured followed the offending car
to the garage with tongue, hands, and arms all in rapid
motion. She was giving the chauffeur a tongue-lashing
and calling his attention to her soiled clothing. Her
tirade prompted the chauffeur to draw some coins from
his pocket and place them in her hand, and then her hurt
feelings apparently were quickly relieved.</p>

<p>Nice has a delightful climate. It is protected from
the cold winds of the north by hills and mountains
and fanned by the mild breezes of the sea. Royalty,
beauty, and wealth make their abode in this favorite
resort on the shore of the Mediterranean during the
winter season, and English lords, French counts, Russian
princes, German barons, and American millionaires sojourn
at the magnificent hotels or reside in beautiful
villas.</p>

<p>The season of gaiety was just closing when we arrived
and the hotels were not crowded, yet there was much
to see. It was a pleasure to drive on the clean, well-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>paved
avenues, which are shaded by great trees and
lined with handsome homes and white stone hotels,
passing lawns and gardens filled with palms, roses,
choice flowers, and blooming vines. It was interesting
to stroll along the sea front for two or three miles on a
stone pavement fifty feet wide, the popular promenade
of the city, with the waves of the blue sea rolling almost
to your feet on one side and the wide avenue filled
with handsome teams and motor-cars of every description
on the other. It was entertaining to secure a
chair in the park during the afternoon concert,
and, comfortably seated, listen to the military band,
admire the gowns of the French women, and note the
variety of uniforms worn by the French officers. Those
afternoons in the park were very restful for there was no
hurry nor confusion nor crying of wares for sale, and the
balmy sea breeze had a soothing effect on the nerves.</p>

<p>The weather was delightful and the air pure and clear
when, on the morning of April fourth, a party of sixteen
filled the seats of a four-horse drag for a drive from
Nice to Mentone over the famous Corniche road, a round
trip of over forty miles, noted as one of the finest drives
in Europe. We had decided to go to Mentone over the
Upper Corniche road, which winds among the mountains,
and return by the Lower Corniche road, which
follows the shores of the sea.</p>

<p>Our driver snapped his long-lashed whip and the
horses started off as gaily as if they shared our exuberant
spirits.</p>

<p>"That is the river Paillon," said the driver, pointing
to a diminutive stream in the midst of a wide stony bed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
"The river has very little water in it now, but when the
snow melts in the mountains it becomes a torrent."</p>

</div>

<p>The little stream had a peaceful look. Many washer-women
were busily at work along its banks, many clothes
lines were filled with drying garments, and sheets were
bleaching on the stones. A number of red objects in
the distance proved, as we drew nearer, to be a company
of red-trousered French soldiers washing their linen in
the stream. Another company in red trousers and
white shirts marched by us, carrying their bundles to
the river. After leaving the river we passed an immense
public wash trough where forty women were washing
clothes and apparently having a social time. There was
room at the trough for double that number.</p>

<p>The macadamized road winding up the mountain side
in easy grades, supported at many places by walls of
substantial masonry, was in perfect condition. Occasionally
as our team moved slowly upward we heard
the "honk, honk" of a horn and a racing automobile
making a time record flew swiftly by and was soon out
of sight, or rushing down grade around sharp curves
at tremendous speed toward us caused some hearts in
our coach to palpitate in anxiety until the racer had
safely passed.</p>

<p>"At this spot a Russian Count and his friend were
killed on the morning of the races," said our driver as
we rounded one particularly sharp curve. "The count,
expecting to be a winner in the race, was speeding his
motor-car at the rate of fifty miles an hour, when it
swerved against the rocks and he and his friend were
hurled over the wall and crushed to death."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span></p>

<p>As we ascended the mountains we saw on the slopes
below us orchards of gray olive trees, in the valleys
orchards of dark green orange and lemon trees filled
with yellow fruit, clean looking white or yellow or pink
houses with red tile roofs dotting the landscape, and the
white stone Hotel Regina, beautiful for situation, standing
prominent on a summit. The rocks in the channel
of the Paillon appeared to be a bed of pebbles. In the
distance, to the south, could be seen the buildings of the
city we had left and the glistening waters of the sea
beyond; on the north, wooded hills and terraced mountains;
and far away, the snow covered summits of the
Alps. While we gazed at one of these scenes of beauty,
the soft mellow tones of a convent bell came pleasingly
to our ears.</p>

<p>"Why is it the bells ring so sweetly here?" inquired
one of the occupants of our coach. "It must have been
melodious notes like these that pleased the ear of the
poet Moore."</p>

<p>At each turn of the road our point of view changed
and the panorama unrolled before us. We looked down
upon a series of beautiful pictures. The Mediterranean
lay two thousand feet below us, its surface reflecting
every shade of blue and green, its coast a succession of
inlets, bays, promontories, and peninsulas. White
roads winding among the shrubbery on the peninsulas
looked like white ribbons on a green background, the
red tiled houses like little toys, and the harbor of Ville
Franche like a pond on which floated tiny boats that
a child might play with.</p>

<p>"What a picturesque town!" exclaimed a tourist.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is the city of Eze. It is a very old city," said
the driver.</p>

<p>"Perched among the mountains, with its odd castle
on a detached hill top," said one of the tourists "it reminds
me of a painting by one of the old masters.
Cimabue, I think, or Perugino. I cannot remember
which. I am constantly regretting while traveling
abroad that we are not more proficient in history and art.
While the professor and the artist were with the party
we could turn to them for information. But now we
must depend upon ourselves."</p>

<p>"Not necessarily," replied another, "for we have
Baedeker and the guides; and there are the drivers,
too, to call upon when they can understand our English
or we can understand their French."</p>

<p>For some distance beyond Eze the road followed the
side of rugged limestone cliffs surmounted by fortifications
and signal stations. At the old, queer-looking
town of La Turbie, while the horses rested for an hour,
we selected postal cards and took kodak views. Soon
after leaving La Turbie, while descending the mountain,
we looked down upon the little principality of Monaco,
its capital, the city of Monaco, the palace of the Prince
built upon a rocky promontory, and the white buildings
of Monte Carlo.</p>

<p>Mentone is a popular winter resort on the Mediterranean
with handsome houses and flower-filled gardens.
Vineyards and groves of orange, lemon, and fig trees,
cover the hillsides surrounding the city. We lunched in
Mentone, and were entertained under the palm trees
of the hotel garden by a band of Italian musicians, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
of whom, an amusing character actor as well as singer,
responded cheerfully to our requests for special selections
and solos.</p>

</div>

<p>Our return from Mentone to Nice was through a succession
of towns and villages. Along this coast road
are many white hotels, comfortable-looking villas, and
trimly kept lawns. In the gardens there were century
plants, orange, lemon, and palm trees, and rose bushes
of great size covered with bloom. On the tops of the
garden walls, plants of various kinds were growing.
Some of the walls were covered with long clusters of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
pink geraniums, some gracefully festooned with masses
of overhanging heliotrope, and others draped with
trailing vines aglow with scarlet bloom. The exuberant
growth and bloom of these flowers attracted much
attention and drew forth exclamations of delight.</p>

<p>"Did you ever see geraniums and heliotropes growing
in such luxuriance?" asked one of the ladies.</p>

<p>"Only in my own state," replied a Californian.
"There the plants grow to immense size and bloom in
profusion."</p>

<p>"Do not forget charming Funchal," said another.
"Remember that there we saw geraniums and fuschias
of wonderful size, and vines of pink bouguainvillia that
covered the mountain-side cottages."</p>

<p>At Monte Carlo, as we drove through the park that
surrounds the white marble gambling palace, we admired
the magnificent parterres of flowers, the beds of
pansies being especially beautiful in variety of color and
size of the flowers. On the piazza of the Café de Paris,
where a band was playing, we had afternoon tea and
from there watched the throng of visitors who were
moving along the palm-lined paths or were ascending
or descending the marble steps of the Casino.</p>

<p>"Is there a charge for admittance?" we inquired of the
guard at the entrance of the white palace.</p>

<p>"No," he replied. "Present your visiting card at the
desk of the Secretary in the corridor. He will approve.
Then, after you have registered your name, a card of
admission will be given you."</p>

<p>In the decorated rooms where the games of chance
were in operation, many handsomely gowned women and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
well-dressed men were moving from place to place conversing
in quiet tones, but crowds were centered around
the roulette tables, where the chairs were all occupied
and many people were standing. We joined the throng
around one of these and saw that the table was divided
into numbered spaces, some colored red and some black.
In the centre of the table was a little wheel with spaces
to correspond in number and color to those on the table.
The stakes were silver five franc pieces, one or more.
No other coins nor bills were permitted on the table.</p>

<p>"I will try it," said one of our party after watching
the game awhile. "I will place a five franc on number
seven black."</p>

<p>The table was dotted with silver coins. The croupier
touched a spring that sent a small ball spinning around
the wheel. The ball stopped in space three red.</p>

<p>"Three red wins," announced the croupier.</p>

<p>A woman with gray hair and large diamonds in her
ears picked up her winnings and added them to the
stack of silver on the table in front of her, and the
croupiers with wooden rakes raked in scores of coins
that had been laid on losing numbers.</p>

<p>At some of the tables in the magnificent apartments
of the Casino the stakes were higher, twenty franc gold
pieces being used, and at these tables, eager players,
infatuated with the game, hazarded handfuls of gold on
the turn of the wheel.</p>

<p>"The chances to win or lose appear to be about even,"
said the Californian. "They must, however, be in
favor of the Casino; for the company requires a large
income to meet the enormous expenses incurred in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
keeping up this handsome palace and grounds with
thousands of employees, croupiers, guards, gardeners,
and care-takers. In addition, the company pays a
heavy tax to the Prince of Monaco, and yet is said to
have large profit."</p>

<p>When our coach arrived at the hotel in Nice some one
remarked: "You appear to be enthusiastic over your
drive." We were; there was no doubt about it, and
we might well have added that we were just as well
pleased with the whole trip to the Orient. We started
with great expectations and we were not disappointed.</p>

<p>At Nice, when the Moltke sailed for New York, we
parted with feelings of regret from many pleasant friends
and companions whose acquaintance we had made during
the trip, and with whom we had been agreeably
associated on sea and on land.</p>
